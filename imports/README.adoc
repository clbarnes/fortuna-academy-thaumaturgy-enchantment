= imports directory

Directory for content from external dependencies (base rule systems, additional modules) included as https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules[git submodules].

In a thriving open source ecosystem, you may want to include other works within your own - for example, base rule systems, settings, or optional modules on which your source book is based.
Use https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules[git submodules] to add such works to the `imports/` directory, and then `include` them from there, making sure to abide by the terms of their license.
This ensures that you refer to a specific revision of the work, that it is easy to find, and that output styles can be consistent.

Note that these external projects may set some variables which affect your own document following their inclusion (e.g. `:imagesdir:`).
