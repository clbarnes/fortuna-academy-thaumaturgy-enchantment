= The Fortuna Academy for Thaumaturgy and Enchantment

Based on a template for writing content similar to RPG source books using https://asciidoctor.org/[asciidoctor], hosted at https://github.com/open-ttrpg-library/rpg-template-adoc[open-ttrpg-library/rpg-template-adoc].

== This repo

This repository contains all the boilerplate you need for

* Installing the asciidoctor toolchain in a cross-platform way
  * Add to `./Gemfile` if you need additional extensions
* Building an asciidoctor document out of component parts
  * Modify `./Rakefile.rb` to customise thise
* Automatically deploying the output as a web page to https://pages.github.com/[Github Pages], as well as releasing PDFs and epubs through GitHub

== Usage

Install https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/[Ruby] and https://bundler.io/[Bundler].

This project's dependencies can be installed in a project-local directory with `bundle install`.
Then, different targets can be built (in `./build`) using the command `bundle exec rake <TARGET>`,
where `<TARGET>` can be `html`, `epub`, `pdf`, or empty for all of them.
The target `clean` will remove all built files.

See the https://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoc-writers-guide/[AsciiDoc Writer's Guide], or for more details on the syntax, the https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/[User Manual].

One of asciidoctor's strengths is building a large document from component parts.
This template has separate top-level directories for asciidoctor documents which will be included as sections, images, tables.
You can even import entire asciidoctor projects from other contributors (for example, if you share a common ruleset)!

:leveloffset: +2

include::sections/README.adoc[]

include::images/README.adoc[]

include::tables/README.adoc[]

include::imports/README.adoc[]

The resulting artifacts have a directory too:

include::build/README.adoc[]

:leveloffset: -2

Always include a `LICENSE.adoc` with your product if you would like it to be accessible to others.
