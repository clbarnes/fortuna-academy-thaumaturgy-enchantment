= section directory

Keep asciidoctor content in here if you do not want a monolithic top-level `index.adoc`.
Then include them in your document with the https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest/directives/include/[include directive].
If there are multiple subdirectories, consider keeping an `index.adoc` in each one to allow an entire directory's ordered content to be ``include``d at once.
