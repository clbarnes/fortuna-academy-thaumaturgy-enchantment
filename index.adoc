_Fortuna's_ is based on the https://evilhat.com/product/fate-condensed/[Fate Condensed] system, for easy-to-start, hard-to-stop games full of competent, proactive, and dramatic characters.
The _Fortuna's_ experience is one of collaborative storytelling rather than linear number-crunching.

== Setting

Thaumaturges (users of magic) exist in a reality almost parallel to our own Mundane one.
They can see and do everything we can (although their auras tend to interfere with electronic devices), as well as interacting with a host of other planes, places, creatures, and characters.
Even among this mysterious community, the Fortuna Academy for Thaumaturgy and Enchantment, colloquially referred to as Fortuna's, is a mystery unto itself.
The enigmatic Ms Fortuna has presided over the boarding school for as long as anyone can remember.
While her former students are scattered throughout the magical world, few can put together more than a handful of the Academy's secrets, or even details of Ms Fortuna herself.

Fortuna's students come from a wide geographical region, as the Academy itself seems to have no fixed location: some alumni recall seeing the same scenery for their entire tenure, while others report awaking to misty moors, frosty peaks, dense jungles, and even a horizon of unbroken ocean in the space of a week.

Thaumaturges' magical backgrounds are even more diverse.
Students range from scions of storied magical bloodlines, to Mundanes who dug too deep into the darkest corners of the public library.
Dragons trapped in humanoid form, descendants of celestials, revenants who have bargained with Those Below, heirs to elven thrones, and cursed puppets have all called Fortuna's their alma mater.

Nobody knows how Ms Fortuna selects or even identifies prospective students, but the prestige of the Academy is such that few ever turn down an invitation.
Students simply receive a communication bearing the legendary school motto _curiosos Fortuna iuvat_, with instructions on how and when to enter the Academy.
On the first Tuesday after the southward equinox, term begins.

Game masters and their groups are encouraged to collaboratively build their own experience within this loose setting.
Some ideas are contained in the Game Master section of this book (so as not to spoil the mystery for potential players).

== Rules

The core mechanics of _Fortuna's_ are explained in https://evilhat.com/product/fate-condensed/[Evil Hat Games' Fate Condensed], for which a System Reference Document is available https://fate-srd.com/fate-condensed[here] and in the appendix of this book.
_Fortuna's_ is not endorsed by or affiliated with Evil Hat Games in any way.

=== Character creation

==== Aspects

Aspects are short phrases which describe who your character is, and will be used by you and others to progress the narrative.
A good aspect is a double-edged sword: it will advantage and disadvantage you in different situations.
Aspects used to your detriment (_compels_, which change the narrative, or _hostile invokes_, which provide a mechanical disadvantage) will earn you Fate points.
You can _compel_ yourself to gain Fate points.
Fate points can be spent on _invokes_ (gaining mechanical advantages based on your Aspects) or inflicting _compels_ or _hostile invokes_ on an opponent.

Your character will start with 5 Aspect slots.
They are:

.High concept
Who _is_ your character, really?

.Thaumaturgical background
How and why do you have your powers?

.Relationship
Some link to another player character.
Remember, this should be a balance: you don't want to set up a nemesis you would never work with, nor a friendship so cosy that this aspect could never be invoked against you!

.Report card standout
Some feature of your curricular experience of the Academy.
It could be a teacher who just won't get off your back, a favourite class, or a record-breaking streak of detentions.

.Free slot
Whatever you want!

==== Skills

_Fortuna's_ uses a two-column skill system.

Your character has a certain degree of aptitude for particular Actions they may try to accomplish.
Additionally, they have a grade in each of their seven Classes at the Academy.

When you make a skill roll, pick the Action which most closely describes what you're trying to do.
The table can discuss this if you're unsure, and the GM has final say.
Sometimes, the same goal can be achieved through different means: you could break down a door, pick the lock, or sweet-talk the animated door knocker -- but that doesn't mean each avenue has the same chance of success.

If your thaumaturgical knowledge or abilities come into play, you may add the modifier from the relevant Class.
Again, which Class you choose can be negotiated.

.Action
- *Endure*
- *Fight*
// - *Know*
- *Know Mundane*
- *Know Thaumaturgy*
- *Move*
- *Notice*
- *Pilot*
- *Resource*
- *Sneak*
- *Speak*
- *Tinker*

Players may distribute the following scores to their Action skills: one Good (+3), two Fair (+2), three Average (+1), three Mediocre (+0), and two Poor (-1).

.Class
- *Artificing*: the creation and use of arcane devices, potions, and artefacts
- *Clairvoyance*: the uncanny knowledge of the past, present, future
- *Kinetica*: the control of movement through the physical realm
- *Mentalism*: the art of mind-reading, communication, and illusion
- *Metamorphics*: the changing of one thing into another
- *Naturalia*: the study of supernatural flora, fauna, and fiends
- *Stoicheiology*: the manipulation of elemental forces (air, earth, fire, water, aether, and others)

First-year characters may distribute the following scores to their Class grades: one Fair (+2), two Average (+1), two Mediocre (+0), and two Poor (-1).

=== Lessons

=== Non-player characters (NPCs)

This section offers some suggestions of characters your players may come across in the game.

==== Staff

// head
.Ms Fortuna
The headmistress of the Academy is rarely seen, and revels in her cloak of enigma.
Few students have met her in person, and little is known of her life or methods.
Should a player come into her presence, they would be met with an eldritch vision difficult to focus on.
It most closely resembles a series of floating cubes, shifting and uncountable.
Hearing her speak is like standing in the midst of many conversations: it is only after the end of a sentence that the memory of the cacophony resolves into a cohesive sentiment.

// artificing

.Professor Werkza (Artificing)
Werkza is a goblin, her thin white hair scraped into a greasy bun pinned with a variety of hand tools.
She is dwarfed by most students (even the dwarves), but rarely enters the workshop on her own two feet.
She will variously stomp, bounce, flutter, or roll around the room aboard whatever contraption is holding her frenetic attention on any given day.

// clairvoyance

.A crystal ball (Clairvoyance)
Auditing Clairvoyance lessons has proved quite impossible.
There is no member of staff assigned to teach this class, nor a curriculum to follow: students seem simply to gaze into a glassy orb at the front of the classroom for an hour at a time.
Nevertheless, their exam results are in many cases exemplary.
// tighten this up, more Zoom metaphors
A previous school administration attempted to deliver more lessons in remote locations in a similar fashion, but it was deemed too silly to continue.

// kinetica

.Mrs Rangelwurst (Kinetica)
The school's Kinetica teacher is a troll, who also serves as head coach for its sports teams.
Whether she can cast any actual spells remains to be seen, but woe betide any student who can't evade a Sphere of Rebounding by the end of their first class.

// mentalism

.Dr Bernard Holden (Mentalism)
The Mentalism teacher is known for his tenacious oral examinations of students, bordering on interrogations.
His nickname is the _"Why?" Tyrant_.
He wears a thick monocle.
Several, in fact - one for his large central eye, and more for the dozens of lesser eyes on stalks covering his hovering spherical body.

// metamorphics

.The Sludge (Metamorphics)
This Metamorphics teacher is decanted into a large round-bottomed flask at the start of every day: from whence is not known to the students.
What the lessons lack in physical demonstration is made up by the Sludge's feverishly meticulous descriptions of the mutability of form.

// naturalia

.Professor Bearington (Naturalia)
This Naturalia teacher cuts a hulking figure, with shaggy dark hair and beady eyes.
His intimidating countenance and gruff manner belie his true nature as an intellectual and caring steward of the magical wilderness.
Also, he is a bear.

// stoicheiology

.Dr Oppensteiner (Stoicheiology)
The Stoicheiology professor came to the thaumaturgical world late in life, after an extensive career in mundane physics.
He has never quite recovered from the transition, and alternates between razor focus on the subject at hand, and staring around the room with a look of vague glassy-eyed surprise.
