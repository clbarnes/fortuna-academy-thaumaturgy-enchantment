<p><em>The Fortuna Academy for Thaumaturgy and Enchantment</em> ("<em>Fortuna&#8217;s</em>") is a tabletop role-playing game, where you play a young character attending a school for magic users.

<p><em>Fortuna&#8217;s</em> is based on the <a href="https://evilhat.com/product/fate-condensed/">Fate Condensed</a> system, for easy-to-start, hard-to-stop games full of competent, proactive, and dramatic characters.
The <em>Fortuna&#8217;s</em> experience is one of collaborative storytelling rather than linear number-crunching.</p>

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Thaumaturges (users of magic) exist in a reality almost parallel to our own Mundane one.
They can see and do everything we can (although their auras tend to interfere with electronic devices), as well as interacting with a host of other planes, places, creatures, and characters.
Even among this mysterious community, the Fortuna Academy for Thaumaturgy and Enchantment, colloquially referred to as Fortuna&#8217;s, is a mystery unto itself.
The enigmatic Ms Fortuna has presided over the boarding school for as long as anyone can remember.
While her former students are scattered throughout the magical world, few can put together more than a handful of the Academy&#8217;s secrets, or even details of Ms Fortuna herself.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Fortuna&#8217;s students come from a wide geographical region, as the Academy itself seems to have no fixed location: some alumni recall seeing the same scenery for their entire tenure, while others report awaking to misty moors, frosty peaks, dense jungles, and even a horizon of unbroken ocean in the space of a week.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Thaumaturges' magical backgrounds are even more diverse.
Students range from scions of storied magical bloodlines, to Mundanes who dug too deep into the darkest corners of the public library.
Dragons trapped in humanoid form, descendants of celestials, revenants who have bargained with Those Below, heirs to elven thrones, and cursed puppets have all called Fortuna&#8217;s their alma mater.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Nobody knows how Ms Fortuna selects or even identifies prospective students, but the prestige of the Academy is such that few ever turn down an invitation.
Students simply receive a communication bearing the legendary school motto <em>curiosos Fortuna iuvat</em>, with instructions on how and when to enter the Academy.
On the first Tuesday after the southward equinox, term begins.</p>
</div>
</div>

<h2 id="_rules"><a class="anchor" href="#_rules"></a><a class="link" href="#_rules">2. Rules</a></h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The core mechanics of <em>Fortuna&#8217;s</em> are explained in <a href="https://evilhat.com/product/fate-condensed/">Evil Hat Games' Fate Condensed</a>, for which a System Reference Document is available <a href="https://fate-srd.com/fate-condensed">here</a> and at the end of this book.

<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_aspects"><a class="anchor" href="#_aspects"></a><a class="link" href="#_aspects">2.1.1. Aspects</a></h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Aspects are short phrases which describe who your character is, and will be used by you and others to progress the narrative.
A good aspect is a double-edged sword: it will advantage and disadvantage you in different situations.
Aspects used against you (<em>compels</em>, which change the narrative, or <em>hostile invokes</em>, which provide a mechanical disadvantage) will earn you Fate points.
Fate points can be spent on <em>invokes</em> (gaining mechanical advantages based on your Aspects) or inflicting <em>compels</em> or <em>hostile invokes</em> on an opponent.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Your character will start with 5 Aspect slots.
They are:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<div class="title">High concept</div>
<p>Who <em>is</em> your character, really?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<div class="title">Thaumaturgical background</div>
<p>How and why do you have your powers?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<div class="title">Relationship</div>
<p>Some link to another player character.
Remember, this should be a balance: you don&#8217;t want to set up a nemesis you would never work with, nor a friendship so cosy that this aspect could never be invoked against you!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<div class="title">Report card standout</div>
<p>Some feature of your curricular experience of the Academy.
It could be a teacher who just won&#8217;t get off your back, a favourite class, or a record-breaking streak of detentions.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<div class="title">Free slot</div>
<p>Whatever you want!</p>

<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_skills"><a class="anchor" href="#_skills"></a><a class="link" href="#_skills">2.1.2. Skills</a></h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>Fortuna&#8217;s</em> uses a two-column skill system.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Your character has a certain degree of aptitude for particular Actions they may try to accomplish.
Additionally, they have a grade in each of their seven Classes at the Academy!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When you make a skill roll, pick the Action which most closely describes what you&#8217;re trying to do.
The table can discuss this if you&#8217;re unsure, and the GM has final say.
Sometimes, the same goal can be achieved through different means: you could break down a door, pick the lock, or sweet-talk the animated door knocker&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;but that doesn&#8217;t mean each avenue has the same chance of success.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If your thaumaturgical knowledge or abilities come into play, you may add the modifier from the relevant Class.
Again, which Class you choose can be negotiated.</p>

    CREATIVE COMMONS CORPORATION IS NOT A LAW FIRM AND DOES NOT PROVIDE
    LEGAL SERVICES. DISTRIBUTION OF THIS LICENSE DOES NOT CREATE AN
    ATTORNEY-CLIENT RELATIONSHIP. CREATIVE COMMONS PROVIDES THIS
    INFORMATION ON AN "AS-IS" BASIS. CREATIVE COMMONS MAKES NO WARRANTIES
    REGARDING THE INFORMATION PROVIDED, AND DISCLAIMS LIABILITY FOR
    DAMAGES RESULTING FROM ITS USE.

License

THE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS CREATIVE
COMMONS PUBLIC LICENSE ("CCPL" OR "LICENSE"). THE WORK IS PROTECTED BY
COPYRIGHT AND/OR OTHER APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF THE WORK OTHER THAN AS
AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS LICENSE OR COPYRIGHT LAW IS PROHIBITED.

BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE
TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE. TO THE EXTENT THIS LICENSE MAY
BE CONSIDERED TO BE A CONTRACT, THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU THE RIGHTS
CONTAINED HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH TERMS AND
CONDITIONS.

1. Definitions

 a. "Adaptation" means a work based upon the Work, or upon the Work and
    other pre-existing works, such as a translation, adaptation,
    derivative work, arrangement of music or other alterations of a
    literary or artistic work, or phonogram or performance and includes
    cinematographic adaptations or any other form in which the Work may be
    recast, transformed, or adapted including in any form recognizably
    derived from the original, except that a work that constitutes a
    Collection will not be considered an Adaptation for the purpose of
    this License. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical
    work, performance or phonogram, the synchronization of the Work in
    timed-relation with a moving image ("synching") will be considered an
    Adaptation for the purpose of this License.
 b. "Collection" means a collection of literary or artistic works, such as
    encyclopedias and anthologies, or performances, phonograms or
    broadcasts, or other works or subject matter other than works listed
    in Section 1(f) below, which, by reason of the selection and
    arrangement of their contents, constitute intellectual creations, in
    which the Work is included in its entirety in unmodified form along
    with one or more other contributions, each constituting separate and
    independent works in themselves, which together are assembled into a
    collective whole. A work that constitutes a Collection will not be
    considered an Adaptation (as defined above) for the purposes of this
    License.
 c. "Distribute" means to make available to the public the original and
    copies of the Work or Adaptation, as appropriate, through sale or
    other transfer of ownership.
 d. "Licensor" means the individual, individuals, entity or entities that
    offer(s) the Work under the terms of this License.
 e. "Original Author" means, in the case of a literary or artistic work,
    the individual, individuals, entity or entities who created the Work
    or if no individual or entity can be identified, the publisher; and in
    addition (i) in the case of a performance the actors, singers,
    musicians, dancers, and other persons who act, sing, deliver, declaim,
    play in, interpret or otherwise perform literary or artistic works or
    expressions of folklore; (ii) in the case of a phonogram the producer
    being the person or legal entity who first fixes the sounds of a
    performance or other sounds; and, (iii) in the case of broadcasts, the
    organization that transmits the broadcast.
 f. "Work" means the literary and/or artistic work offered under the terms
    of this License including without limitation any production in the
    literary, scientific and artistic domain, whatever may be the mode or
    form of its expression including digital form, such as a book,
    pamphlet and other writing; a lecture, address, sermon or other work
    of the same nature; a dramatic or dramatico-musical work; a
    choreographic work or entertainment in dumb show; a musical
    composition with or without words; a cinematographic work to which are
    assimilated works expressed by a process analogous to cinematography;
    a work of drawing, painting, architecture, sculpture, engraving or
    lithography; a photographic work to which are assimilated works
    expressed by a process analogous to photography; a work of applied
    art; an illustration, map, plan, sketch or three-dimensional work
    relative to geography, topography, architecture or science; a
    performance; a broadcast; a phonogram; a compilation of data to the
    extent it is protected as a copyrightable work; or a work performed by
    a variety or circus performer to the extent it is not otherwise
    considered a literary or artistic work.
 g. "You" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this
    License who has not previously violated the terms of this License with
    respect to the Work, or who has received express permission from the
    Licensor to exercise rights under this License despite a previous
    violation.
 h. "Publicly Perform" means to perform public recitations of the Work and
    to communicate to the public those public recitations, by any means or
    process, including by wire or wireless means or public digital
    performances; to make available to the public Works in such a way that
    members of the public may access these Works from a place and at a
    place individually chosen by them; to perform the Work to the public
    by any means or process and the communication to the public of the
    performances of the Work, including by public digital performance; to
    broadcast and rebroadcast the Work by any means including signs,
    sounds or images.
 i. "Reproduce" means to make copies of the Work by any means including
    without limitation by sound or visual recordings and the right of
    fixation and reproducing fixations of the Work, including storage of a
    protected performance or phonogram in digital form or other electronic
    medium.

2. Fair Dealing Rights. Nothing in this License is intended to reduce,
limit, or restrict any uses free from copyright or rights arising from
limitations or exceptions that are provided for in connection with the
copyright protection under copyright law or other applicable laws.

3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License,
Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive,
perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright) license to
exercise the rights in the Work as stated below:

 a. to Reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more
    Collections, and to Reproduce the Work as incorporated in the
    Collections;
 b. to create and Reproduce Adaptations provided that any such Adaptation,
    including any translation in any medium, takes reasonable steps to
    clearly label, demarcate or otherwise identify that changes were made
    to the original Work. For example, a translation could be marked "The
    original work was translated from English to Spanish," or a
    modification could indicate "The original work has been modified.";
 c. to Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work including as incorporated
    in Collections; and,
 d. to Distribute and Publicly Perform Adaptations.
 e. For the avoidance of doubt:

     i. Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in
        which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or
        compulsory licensing scheme cannot be waived, the Licensor
        reserves the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any
        exercise by You of the rights granted under this License;
    ii. Waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in
        which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or
        compulsory licensing scheme can be waived, the Licensor waives the
        exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You
        of the rights granted under this License; and,
   iii. Voluntary License Schemes. The Licensor waives the right to
        collect royalties, whether individually or, in the event that the
        Licensor is a member of a collecting society that administers
        voluntary licensing schemes, via that society, from any exercise
        by You of the rights granted under this License.

The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now
known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make
such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in
other media and formats. Subject to Section 8(f), all rights not expressly
granted by Licensor are hereby reserved.

4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made
subject to and limited by the following restrictions:

 a. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the terms
    of this License. You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource
    Identifier (URI) for, this License with every copy of the Work You
    Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose any terms
    on the Work that restrict the terms of this License or the ability of
    the recipient of the Work to exercise the rights granted to that
    recipient under the terms of the License. You may not sublicense the
    Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and
    to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work You
    Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or Publicly
    Perform the Work, You may not impose any effective technological
    measures on the Work that restrict the ability of a recipient of the
    Work from You to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under
    the terms of the License. This Section 4(a) applies to the Work as
    incorporated in a Collection, but this does not require the Collection
    apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this
    License. If You create a Collection, upon notice from any Licensor You
    must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collection any credit
    as required by Section 4(b), as requested. If You create an
    Adaptation, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent
    practicable, remove from the Adaptation any credit as required by
    Section 4(b), as requested.
 b. If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any Adaptations or
    Collections, You must, unless a request has been made pursuant to
    Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and
    provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the
    name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied,
    and/or if the Original Author and/or Licensor designate another party
    or parties (e.g., a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for
    attribution ("Attribution Parties") in Licensor's copyright notice,
    terms of service or by other reasonable means, the name of such party
    or parties; (ii) the title of the Work if supplied; (iii) to the
    extent reasonably practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor
    specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not
    refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the Work;
    and (iv) , consistent with Section 3(b), in the case of an Adaptation,
    a credit identifying the use of the Work in the Adaptation (e.g.,
    "French translation of the Work by Original Author," or "Screenplay
    based on original Work by Original Author"). The credit required by
    this Section 4 (b) may be implemented in any reasonable manner;
    provided, however, that in the case of a Adaptation or Collection, at
    a minimum such credit will appear, if a credit for all contributing
    authors of the Adaptation or Collection appears, then as part of these
    credits and in a manner at least as prominent as the credits for the
    other contributing authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You may only
    use the credit required by this Section for the purpose of attribution
    in the manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights under this
    License, You may not implicitly or explicitly assert or imply any
    connection with, sponsorship or endorsement by the Original Author,
    Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your
    use of the Work, without the separate, express prior written
    permission of the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution
    Parties.
 c. Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be
    otherwise permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce, Distribute or
    Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or as part of any
    Adaptations or Collections, You must not distort, mutilate, modify or
    take other derogatory action in relation to the Work which would be
    prejudicial to the Original Author's honor or reputation. Licensor
    agrees that in those jurisdictions (e.g. Japan), in which any exercise
    of the right granted in Section 3(b) of this License (the right to
    make Adaptations) would be deemed to be a distortion, mutilation,
    modification or other derogatory action prejudicial to the Original
    Author's honor and reputation, the Licensor will waive or not assert,
    as appropriate, this Section, to the fullest extent permitted by the
    applicable national law, to enable You to reasonably exercise Your
    right under Section 3(b) of this License (right to make Adaptations)
    but not otherwise.

5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer

UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR
OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY
KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE,
INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY,
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF
LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS,
WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION
OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE
LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR
ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES
ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS
BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

7. Termination

 a. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
    automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License.
    Individuals or entities who have received Adaptations or Collections
    from You under this License, however, will not have their licenses
    terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full
    compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will
    survive any termination of this License.
 b. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is
    perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work).
    Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the
    Work under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at
    any time; provided, however that any such election will not serve to
    withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is
    required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this
    License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as
    stated above.

8. Miscellaneous

 a. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a Collection,
    the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same
    terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.
 b. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation, Licensor
    offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same
    terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.
 c. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under
    applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of
    the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action
    by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to
    the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and
    enforceable.
 d. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no
    breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing
    and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.
 e. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with
    respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings,
    agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified
    here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that
    may appear in any communication from You. This License may not be
    modified without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You.
 f. The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in this
    License were drafted utilizing the terminology of the Berne Convention
    for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (as amended on
    September 28, 1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the WIPO Copyright
    Treaty of 1996, the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty of 1996
    and the Universal Copyright Convention (as revised on July 24, 1971).
    These rights and subject matter take effect in the relevant
    jurisdiction in which the License terms are sought to be enforced
    according to the corresponding provisions of the implementation of
    those treaty provisions in the applicable national law. If the
    standard suite of rights granted under applicable copyright law
    includes additional rights not granted under this License, such
    additional rights are deemed to be included in the License; this
    License is not intended to restrict the license of any rights under
    applicable law.

<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is <em>Fate Condensed</em>, a version of <em>Fate Core System</em> in as compact
a form as we can manage. It is a complete roleplaying game; while other
books might enhance your use of it, you don’t need any other book to
play.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>On that note, let’s get into what you <em>do</em> need!</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="what-do-i-need-to-play-"><a class="anchor" href="#what-do-i-need-to-play-"></a><a class="link" href="#what-do-i-need-to-play-">A.1.1. What Do I Need to Play?</a></h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To play <em>Fate Condensed</em> you’ll need two to six friends with one acting
as Game Master (GM), some dice, some tokens, writing implements, paper,
and something to write short notes on (<em>e.g.,</em> small “sticky notes”).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>Fate Condensed</em> uses <strong>Fate Dice™</strong> when characters take action. Fate
dice are six-sided dice with two [0] sides, two [] sides, and two [-]
sides. One set of four dice will work fine, but one set per player is
ideal. Other alternatives exist, such as using standard six-sided dice
(1-2 = [-], 3-4 = [0], 5-6 = []), or the <strong>Deck of Fate</strong>, which uses
cards instead of dice. We use the word “roll” throughout the text for
simplicity.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Condensing the gist of a system from nearly 300 pages down to about 50
pages of text does lead to a few changes. As of this writing it has also
been eight years since <em>Fate Core System</em> was created, so a little
iteration of the design is to be expected. In particular, we highlight
the following:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>We’ve shifted over to one-point stress boxes to help reduce confusion
(<strong>page XX</strong>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“Balsera Style” initiative (also known as “elective action order” or
“popcorn initiative”) is the default rather than using skills to
determine turn order (<strong>page XX</strong>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Advancement functions a little differently; we’ve eliminated
significant milestones and finessed major milestones to compensate
(<strong>page XX</strong>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We’ve removed the notion of active opposition as separate from the
defend action (<strong>page XX</strong>). This has a few minor ripple effects,
particularly overcome’s tie result (<strong>page XX</strong>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Create an Advantage has been tweaked to offer better clarity and
agency around the discovery of existing unknown aspects (<strong>page XX</strong>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Full defense is presented as optional and has been altered a bit to
accommodate the expanded scope of the defend action (<strong>page XX</strong>). Other
standard rules options are presented as well, starting on <strong>page XX</strong>.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Any game of Fate starts with defining your setting. This might be a
concept your GM is bringing to the table, a popular media property the
players are familiar with, or a collaborative world-building exercise
involving everyone at the table. The setting discussion may be quick and
light on detail, or may involve a detailed full session with the whole
group, or anything in between.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Your choice of setting forms the basis of the table’s consensus about
what is true, and what is acceptable in play and in character concepts.
If your setting doesn’t have flying people in it, then a player deciding
to make a flying-person character doesn’t pass muster. If your world
involves shadowy organizations and deep conspiracies, players may expect
story-lines free of clear-cut good-and-evil conflicts and devoid of
farcical murder-clowns. It’s up to you!</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Once you’ve decided on a setting, it’s time for the players to
make characters—also called PCs. Each player
takes on the role of one of the heroes of your story, controlling all
their actions. You get to build the character you want to see in the
world. Keep in mind that Fate characters are competent, dramatic, and
willing to engage with the adventures ahead.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Your PC is made up of several elements:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Aspects:</strong> phrases describing who your hero is</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Skills:</strong> your hero’s areas of relative expertise</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Stunts:</strong> remarkable things your hero does</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Stress:</strong> your hero’s ability to keep calm and carry on</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Consequences:</strong> the wounds, physical and mental, your hero can endure</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Refresh:</strong> a measure of your hero’s narrative agency</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Finishing Touches:</strong> your hero’s personal details</p>

<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_aspects_2"><a class="anchor" href="#_aspects_2"></a><a class="link" href="#_aspects_2">Aspects</a></h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Aspects</strong> are short phrases that describe who your character is or what
is important to them. They can relate to your character’s physical or
mental qualities, history, beliefs, training, relationships, or even
particularly important equipment.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The first thing to know about them is: <strong>Aspects are true</strong> (see <strong>page XX</strong>
for a discussion of this). In other words, how you define your character
is real and true in the story you’re telling. If you write down that
your character is a <strong>Precog Sniper</strong>, then they <em>are</em> a precog sniper.
You’ve told everyone that your character sees the future and is a crack
shot with a rifle.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You’ll also use aspects in play to change the story. They give you
permission to improve your dice rolls and establish facts about the
world. Lastly, aspects can earn you <strong>fate points</strong> if they create
complications for your character—so to make the most versatile aspects,
you should aim for ones that are double-edged, working both for you and
against you.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To learn more about aspects and what makes a good one, consider reading
some of <em>Aspects and Fate Points</em> (<strong>page XX</strong>).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>To begin, you’ll give your character five aspects</strong>: a high concept, a
trouble, a relationship, and two free aspects. Start with the high
concept and go from there.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect5">
<h6 id="_high_concept"><a class="anchor" href="#_high_concept"></a><a class="link" href="#_high_concept">High Concept</a></h6>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Your <strong>high concept</strong> is a broad description of the character, covering
the vital bits. It’s how you would open your pitch for the character
when telling a friend about them.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect5">
<h6 id="_trouble"><a class="anchor" href="#_trouble"></a><a class="link" href="#_trouble">Trouble</a></h6>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Next is your character’s <strong>trouble</strong>—something that makes your character’s
life more complicated. It could be a personal weakness, family
entanglements, or other obligations. Pick something you’ll enjoy
roleplaying!</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect5">
<h6 id="_relationship"><a class="anchor" href="#_relationship"></a><a class="link" href="#_relationship">Relationship</a></h6>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Your <strong>relationship</strong> describes a connection with another PC. They may
already know one another, or have just met.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Good relationship aspects should introduce or hint at conflict, or at
least an imbalance that gives the relationship a little momentum. This
doesn’t mean they are openly antagonistic, but they shouldn’t be all
roses either.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you wish, you can wait to write down relationship aspects until
everyone has more or less completed their characters.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect5">
<h6 id="_free_aspects"><a class="anchor" href="#_free_aspects"></a><a class="link" href="#_free_aspects">Free Aspects</a></h6>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can make your character’s last two aspects anything you want—there
are no restrictions beyond the obligation to fit the setting. Choose
anything which you think will make your character more interesting, more
fun to play, or better connected to the world they occupy.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_skills_2"><a class="anchor" href="#_skills_2"></a><a class="link" href="#_skills_2">Skills</a></h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>While aspects define who your character is, <strong>skills</strong> show what they can
do. Each skill describes a broad activity your character might have
learned through study and practice or simply have an innate talent for.
A character with Burglary is capable, to some degree, at all manner of
crime relating to the fine art of burgling—casing a joint, bypassing
security, pick-pocketing, and lock-picking.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Each skill has a <strong>rating</strong>. The higher the rating, the better the
character is at the skill. As a whole, your character’s skills will show
you what actions they are built for, which ones they’ll get by on, and
which aren’t their forte.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You’ll choose your character’s skill ratings, arranged in a pyramid with
the highest-rated skill at Great (+4), as follows:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>One Great (+4) skill</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Two Good (+3) skills</p>

<li>
<p>Three Fair (+2) skills</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Academics:</strong> Mundane, everyday human knowledge and education, including
history, sciences, and medicine. Academics stunts often refer to
specialized areas of knowledge and medical skills.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Athletics:</strong> A measurement of physical potential. Athletics stunts focus
on movement—running, jumping, parkour—and dodging attacks.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Burglary:</strong> Knowledge of and ability to bypass security systems, pick
pockets, and generally commit crimes. Burglary stunts give bonuses to
the various stages of committing a crime, from the planning to the
execution and escape.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Contacts:</strong> Knowledge of the right people and connections that can help
you. Contacts stunts give you ready allies and an information network
wherever you go in the world.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Crafts:</strong> Ability to make or break machinery, build contraptions, and
pull off MacGyver-esque feats of ingenuity. Crafts stunts let you have
the gizmo on hand, give bonuses to building and breaking things, and
provide justification for using Crafts in place of skills like Burglary
or Academics under certain circumstances.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Deceive:</strong> Ability to lie and cheat convincingly and with aplomb.
Deceive stunts might improve your ability to tell a particular breed of
lie or help invent false identities.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Drive:</strong> Controlling vehicles under the most grueling circumstances,
pulling wicked maneuvers, and simply getting the most out of your ride.
Drive stunts can be signature maneuvers, a special vehicle of your own,
or the ability to use Drive in place of a skill like Burglary or
Academics under certain circumstances.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Empathy:</strong> Ability to accurately judge someone’s mood and intentions.
Empathy stunts can be about judging a crowd, picking up on lies, or
helping others recover from mental consequences.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Fight:</strong> Ability to excel at hand-to-hand combat, whether with weapons
or fists. Fight stunts include signature weapons and special techniques.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Investigate:</strong> Deliberate, careful study and puzzling out mysteries. Use
this to piece together clues or reconstruct a crime scene. Investigate
stunts help you form brilliant deductions or piece together information
more quickly.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Lore:</strong> Specialized, arcane knowledge that falls outside of the scope of
Academics, including supernatural topics of one sort or another. This is
where the weird stuff happens. Lore stunts often support practical
applications of your arcane knowledge, such as casting spells. Some
settings may remove Lore, replace it with a different skill, or combine
it with Academics.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Notice:</strong> Ability to pick up details in the moment, spot trouble before
it happens, and generally be perceptive. It contrasts Investigate, which
is for slow, deliberate observation. Notice stunts sharpen your senses,
improve your reaction time, or make you harder to sneak up on.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Physique:</strong> Raw power and durability. Physique stunts let you perform
superhuman feats of strength, throw your weight around while wrestling,
and shrug off physical consequences. In addition, a high Physique rating
gives you more physical stress or consequence slots (<strong>page XX</strong>).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Provoke:</strong> Ability to push people to act the way you want them to. It’s
coarse and manipulative, not a positive interaction. Provoke stunts let
you push opponents into foolhardy action, draw aggression toward you, or
scare enemies (assuming they can feel fear).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Rapport:</strong> Building connections with others and working together. Where
Provoke is manipulation, Rapport is sincerity, trust, and goodwill.
Rapport stunts let you sway the crowd, improve relationships, or build
contacts.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Resources:</strong> Access to material things, not just money or direct
ownership. It might reflect your ability to borrow from friends or dip
into an organization’s armory. Resources stunts let you use Resources in
place of Rapport or Contacts or give you extra free invokes when you pay
for the best.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Shoot:</strong> All forms of ranged combat, whether guns, throwing knives, or
bow and arrow. Shoot stunts let you make called shots, quick-draw, or
always have a gun handy.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Stealth:</strong> Staying unseen or unheard and escaping when you need to hide.
Stealth stunts let you vanish in plain sight, blend into crowds, or
advance through shadows unseen.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Will:</strong> Mental fortitude, the ability to overcome temptation and to
withstand trauma. Will stunts let you ignore mental consequences,
withstand the mental agony of strange powers, and hold steady against
enemies who provoke you. In addition, a high Will rating gives you more
mental stress or consequence slots (<strong>page XX</strong>).</p>

<h6 id="_alternative_skill_lists"><a class="anchor" href="#_alternative_skill_lists"></a><a class="link" href="#_alternative_skill_lists">Alternative Skill Lists</a></h6>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When building your own implementation of Fate, the first thing to think
about is whether or not you’ll keep the same skill list. Often you can
work with the one given, combining, changing, or splitting apart a few
of the skills given. But it’s possible that the granularity of the
default example skill list we’ve given above isn’t to your liking. Here
are some things to think about.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>The default skill list has 19 skills in it, and players rate their
characters above the Mediocre (+0) default in 10 of them. If you change
the number of skills, you may want to change how the ratings are
allocated.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Our default skills are focused on answering the question “what can you
do?”—but your list doesn’t need to follow in line with that. You might
want a list focused on “What do you believe?”, the question “How do you
do things?” (as with approaches in <em>Fate Accelerated</em>), job-roles in a
crew of grifters and thieves, and so on.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Skill ratings in Fate are structured to support character niches.
That’s why, in the default, players start with a “pyramid” shape. Make
sure niche protection is possible in whatever new list you create.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The best starting skill should come in around Great (+4). You can
alter this up or down as you see fit, but make sure to keep an eye on
what that means for the difficulty and opposing skill ratings your PCs
will face.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Fred decides he wants to do a space-faring Fate game with a shorter
skill list that’s focused on action-words. He settles on this 9-item
skill list: Fight, Know, Move, Notice, Pilot, Sneak, Speak, Tinker, and
Will. He also likes the idea of a “diamond” shape for skill ratings
rather than a pyramid, so he has players rate their starting skills as
follows: 1 at Great (+4), 2 at Good (+3), 3 at Fair (+2), 2 at Average
(+1), and 1 at Mediocre (+0). His PCs will have a lot of overlap and
core competencies due to the fat middle of his diamond, while still
enjoying some niche protections at the top of the diamond’s “point.”</p>

<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_refresh"><a class="anchor" href="#_refresh"></a><a class="link" href="#_refresh">Refresh</a></h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Your <strong>refresh</strong> is the minimum number of <strong>fate points</strong> (<strong>page XX</strong>) your
character begins with at the start of each session. Your character
begins with a refresh of 3.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Each session, you start with fate points at least equal to your refresh.
Be sure to keep track of the fate points you have left at the end of
each session of play—if you have more fate points than your refresh,
you’ll start the next session with the fate points you ended this
session with.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Charles earned a lot of fate points during today’s session, ending it
with 5 fate points. His refresh is 2, so Charles will start the next
session with 5 fate points. But Ethan ends the same session with just
one fate point. His refresh is 3, so he’ll begin the next session with 3
fate points, not just the one he had left over.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_stunts"><a class="anchor" href="#_stunts"></a><a class="link" href="#_stunts">Stunts</a></h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>While every character has access to all the skills—even if they are
Mediocre (+0) at most of them—your character has some unique <strong>stunts</strong>.
Stunts are the cool techniques, tricks, or bits of equipment that make
your character unique and interesting. Where skills are about a
character’s broad competencies, stunts are about specific areas of
excellence; most of them give you a bonus in particular circumstances or
let you do something that other characters simply can’t.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Your character begins with three free stunt slots. You don’t have to
define them all right away, and may fill them in as you play. You may
purchase more stunts by spending 1 refresh each, to a minimum of 1
refresh.</p>

<div class="sect5">
<h6 id="_writing_stunts"><a class="anchor" href="#_writing_stunts"></a><a class="link" href="#_writing_stunts">Writing Stunts</a></h6>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You write your own stunts when building a character. Broadly, there are
two types of stunts.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Bonus-granting stunts:</strong> The first type of stunt <strong>gives you a +2 bonus</strong>
when you use a named skill within certain parameters, usually limited to
a specific type of action (<strong>page XX</strong>) and type of narrative
circumstance.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Write this type of stunt as follows:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Because I <strong>[describe how you are amazing or have a cool bit of gear]</strong>, I
get a +2 when I use <strong>[pick a skill]</strong> to <strong>[pick one: overcome, create an
advantage, attack, defend]</strong> when <strong>[describe a circumstance]</strong>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Example Bonus-Granting Stunt:</strong> Because I am <strong>a military-trained
sniper</strong>, I get a +2 when I use <strong>Shoot</strong> to <strong>attack</strong> when <strong>I have a
target</strong> <strong>In My Sights</strong>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Rule-changing stunts:</strong> The second type of stunt <strong>changes the rules of
the game</strong>. This is a broad category that includes, but is not limited
to, the following:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Swapping which skills are used in a given situation.</strong> For instance, a
researcher might use Academics to perform a ritual, while anyone else
would use Lore.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Using an action with a skill that isn’t normally used with it.</strong> For
instance, allowing a character to use Stealth to backstab an opponent
from the shadows (which would typically be a use of Fight).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Giving a character a different kind of bonus to skills that’s roughly
equivalent to a +2.</strong> For instance, when a skilled orator creates an
advantage with Rapport, it gets an extra free invoke.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Allowing a character to declare a minor fact is always true.</strong> For
instance, a survivalist always has survival items like matches on their
person, even under unlikely circumstances.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Allowing a character to make a specific rules exception.</strong> For
instance, a character might have two more stress boxes or another mild
consequence slot.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Write this type of stunt as follows:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Because I <strong>[describe how you are amazing or have a cool bit of gear]</strong>, I
can <strong>[describe your amazing feat]</strong>, but only <strong>[describe a circumstance
or limitation]</strong>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Example Rule-Changing Stunt:</strong> Because I <strong>don’t believe in magic</strong>, I can
<strong>ignore the effects of a supernatural ability</strong>, but only <strong>once per game
session</strong>.</p>
</div>

<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_stress_and_consequences"><a class="anchor" href="#_stress_and_consequences"></a><a class="link" href="#_stress_and_consequences">Stress and Consequences</a></h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Stress</strong> and <strong>consequences</strong> are how your
character withstands the mental and physical toll of their adventures.
Characters have at least three one-point boxes for physical stress and
at least three one-point boxes for mental stress. They also get one slot
each for mild, moderate, and severe consequences.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Your rating in Physique affects how many total physical stress boxes you
have. Will does the same for your mental stress. Refer to the following

<div class="paragraph">
<p>In <em>Fate Condensed</em>, we’re using only one-point stress boxes. <em>Fate Core
System</em> and <em>Fate Accelerated</em> both use a series of escalating-value
boxes (one 1-point box, one 2-point box, etc). You can use that style of
stress box if you like; for this version we decided to stick with
one-point boxes because it’s simple—with the other method, folks can get
confused just a little more easily.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are a few other angles on this style that you’ll want to keep in
mind.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>As you’ll see on <strong>page XX</strong>, with 1-point boxes you may mark as many of
them as you want when you get hit (the escalating-value style of Fate
Core, meanwhile, has a “you can only mark one box per hit” proviso).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This style goes with the Fate Core notion of separate Physical and
Mental stress tracks, instead of a single unified track as with Fate
Accelerated. If you’re inclined towards a unified track, add three more
boxes to make up for it, and use the <em>higher</em> of Physique or Will to
lengthen it as indicated.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Three points of stress absorption on one track is not a lot! If
characters end up feeling a little fragile in play, you may want to add
one or two boxes to the default quantity. It’s all about how fast the
consequences hit. (With the older style, a <strong>[1][2]</strong> track absorbs 2 to 3
stress, <strong>[1][2][3]</strong> = 3 to 6, <strong>[1][2][3][4]</strong> = 4 to 10.)</p>

<p>To act, follow the principle of <strong>fiction first</strong>: say what your character
is trying to do, <em>then</em> figure out how you’ll do that in the system.
Your character’s aspects inform what they can attempt and help set the
context for interpreting the results. Most people couldn’t even try to
perform emergency surgery on a disemboweled ally, but with an aspect
establishing a medical background, you can try. Without that aspect you
might at best buy a few moments for some last words. When in doubt,
check with your GM and the table.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>How do you know if you’re successful? Often, your character will simply
succeed, because the action isn’t hard and nobody’s trying to stop you.
But in difficult or unpredictable situations, you’ll break out the dice
to find out what happens.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When a character wants to take an action, the group should think about
these questions:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>What’s stopping this from happening?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What could go wrong?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How is it interesting when it does go wrong?</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If no one has good answers to all of these questions, it simply happens.
Driving to the airport doesn’t require a roll of the dice. Racing down
the highway to a waiting plane while being pursued by cybernetically
enhanced beasts from another world, on the other hand, is a perfect time
to roll the dice.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Whenever you take action, follow these steps:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>Fiction first: Describe what you’re trying to do, <em>then</em> choose the
skill and action that fits.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Roll four dice.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add up the symbols on the dice: a [+] is +1, [-] is -1, and [0] is 0.
This will give you a dice result of -4 to 4.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add the dice result to your skill rating.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Modify the dice by invoking aspects (<strong>page XX</strong>) and using stunts

<h4 id="_difficulty_and_opposition"><a class="anchor" href="#_difficulty_and_opposition"></a><a class="link" href="#_difficulty_and_opposition">A.3.1. Difficulty and Opposition</a></h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If the character’s action faces a fixed obstacle or otherwise tries to
alter the world rather than a character or creature, their action faces
a static <strong>difficulty</strong> rating. These actions include picking locks,
barring doors, and tactically assessing an enemy camp. The GM may decide
that the presence of certain aspects (on the character, the scene, or
something else) justifies changing the difficulty.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>At other times, an enemy will provide <strong>opposition</strong> against the
character’s action by using a defend action (<strong>page XX</strong>). In these cases,
the GM will also roll the dice and follow the same rules as in the
previous section, using any skills, stunts, or aspects the enemy has.
Any time you roll to attack an enemy or to create an advantage directly
against them, the enemy will roll to defend against it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Opposition can take many forms. Struggling with a cultist over the
ritual dagger has a clear opponent. Or you might be opposed by the power
of an ancient ritual that must be overcome to save the world. Cracking
the safe in the First Metropolitan Bank to access the safe deposit boxes
is a challenge with risk of discovery, but it’s up to the GM if you’re
rolling against <em>opposition</em> from the patrolling guards or the
<em>difficulty</em> presented by the safe itself.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>On your turn, you may modify your dice by invoking aspects to get +2 to
your roll or reroll the dice. Some stunts also give you a bonus. You may
also invoke aspects to support an ally (<strong>page XX</strong>) or to increase the
difficulty an enemy faces.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_invoking_aspects"><a class="anchor" href="#_invoking_aspects"></a><a class="link" href="#_invoking_aspects">Invoking Aspects</a></h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When you take action but the dice come up short,
you don’t have to sit back and accept failure. (Though you totally can.
That’s fun too.) The aspects in play give you options and opportunity to
succeed.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When an aspect could justifiably help your efforts, describe how it
helps and spend a fate point to <strong>invoke</strong> it (or
use a free invoke). What is and isn’t justifiable is subject to the
<strong>bogus rule</strong>—anyone can say “that’s bogus!” to
invoking an aspect. Simply put, the bogus rule is a <strong>calibration tool</strong>
that anyone at the table may use to help the group make sure the game
stays true to its vision and concept. You can use the safety tools
discussed on <strong>page XX</strong> in a similar fashion.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You have two options when your invoke looks bogus. First, you can
retract your invoke and try something else, maybe a different aspect.
Second, you can have a quick discussion about why you think the aspect
fits. If the person still isn’t convinced, retract the invoke and move
on. If they come around to your perspective, go ahead with the invoke as
usual. The bogus rule is in here to help everyone at the table have a
good time. Use it when something doesn’t sound right, make sense, or fit
the tone. Someone invoking <strong>Great at First Impressions</strong> to throw a car
is likely bogus. But maybe that character has a supernatural stunt that
makes them incredibly strong, strong enough to plausibly throw a car,
and this is their opening gambit in a fight with a horrible monster. In
that case, maybe <strong>Great at First Impressions</strong> is plausible.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When you invoke an aspect, you can either <strong>gain a +2 bonus</strong> to your roll
or <strong>reroll all four dice</strong>, or you can add 2 to the difficulty of someone
else’s roll, if justifiable. You can invoke multiple aspects on the same
roll, but you can’t invoke the same aspect multiple times on the same
roll. There is one exception: you can spend as many <em>free invokes</em> on an
aspect as you like on the same roll.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Most often you’ll invoke one of your character aspects, but sometimes
you’ll invoke a situation aspect or even make a hostile invocation of
another character’s aspect (<strong>page XX</strong>).</p>

<p>Stunts may give you a bonus to your roll,

circumstances, action, or skill used. You may wish to use create
advantage (<strong>page XX</strong>) to introduce aspects that line up with those
circumstances. Keep your stunts’ circumstances in mind when you describe
your actions too, and set yourself up for success.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Normally, stunts give you a +2 bonus in a narrow circumstance with no
cost; you may use them anytime they apply. Some rare and exceptionally
powerful stunts may require you to spend a fate point to use them.</p>

<h4 id="_outcomes"><a class="anchor" href="#_outcomes"></a><a class="link" href="#_outcomes">A.3.3. Outcomes</a></h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Whenever you roll dice, the difference between your effort and the
target difficulty or opposition is measured in <strong>shifts</strong>. A shift has a
value of 1. There are four possible outcomes:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>If your effort is less than the target difficulty or opposition, you
<strong>fail</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If your effort is equal to the target, you <strong>tie</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If your effort is one or two shifts more than the target, you
<strong>succeed</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If your effort is three or more shifts more than the target, you
<strong>succeed with style</strong>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Some outcomes are obviously better for you than others, but all of them
should advance the story in interesting ways. You started with fiction
first (<strong>page XX</strong>); make sure you end with it too, to maintain focus on
the story, and to ensure you interpret the results in a way that fits
the fiction.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Ethan isn’t an adept safe-cracker (though he has the tools), and yet

<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_failure"><a class="anchor" href="#_failure"></a><a class="link" href="#_failure">Failure</a></h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If your effort is less than the target difficulty or opposition, you
fail.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This can play out in a few ways: simple failure, success at a major
cost, or taking a hit.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect5">
<h6 id="_simple_failure"><a class="anchor" href="#_simple_failure"></a><a class="link" href="#_simple_failure">Simple Failure</a></h6>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The first is the easiest to understand—<strong>simple failure</strong>. You don’t
accomplish your goal, don’t make any progress, and are left wanting.
Ensure this keeps the story moving—simply failing to crack the safe is
stagnant and boring.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Ethan pulls the handle triumphantly, but the safe remains resolutely
closed while the alarms begin to blare. Failure has changed the
situation and driven the story forward—now there are guards on the way.
Ethan is faced with a new choice—try another way of opening the safe,
now that subtlety is out the window, or cut his losses and run?</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect5">
<h6 id="_success_at_a_major_cost"><a class="anchor" href="#_success_at_a_major_cost"></a><a class="link" href="#_success_at_a_major_cost">Success at a major cost</a></h6>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Second is <strong>success at a major cost</strong>. You do
what you set out to do, but there’s a significant price to be paid—the
situation gets worse or more complicated. GM, you can either declare
this is the result or can offer it in place of failure. Both options are
good and useful in different situations.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Ethan fails his roll and the GM says, “You hear the click of the last
tumbler falling into place. It’s echoed by the click of the hammer on a
revolver as the guard tells you to put your hands in the air.” The major
cost here is the confrontation with a guard he’d hoped to avoid.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect5">
<h6 id="_take_a_hit"><a class="anchor" href="#_take_a_hit"></a><a class="link" href="#_take_a_hit">Take a Hit</a></h6>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Lastly, you may <strong>take a hit</strong>, which you’ll need to absorb with stress or
consequences, or suffer some other drawback. This sort of failure is
most common when defending against attacks or overcoming dangerous
obstacles. This is different from a simple failure because the character
alone, not necessarily the whole group, is affected. It’s also different
from success at a major cost, in that success isn’t necessarily on the
table.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Ethan is able to get the safe door open, but as he grasps the handle, he
feels a jab in the back of his hand. He couldn’t disable the trap! He
writes down the mild consequence <strong>Poisoned</strong>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can mix these options together: Harmful failure can be harsh but
appropriate in the moment. Success at the cost of harm is certainly an
option.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_tie"><a class="anchor" href="#_tie"></a><a class="link" href="#_tie">Tie</a></h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If your effort is equal to the target difficulty or opposition, you tie.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Just like failure, ties should move the story forward, never stymie the
action. Something interesting should happen. Similar to failure, this
can play out a couple ways: success at a minor cost, or partial success.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect5">
<h6 id="_success_at_a_minor_cost"><a class="anchor" href="#_success_at_a_minor_cost"></a><a class="link" href="#_success_at_a_minor_cost">Success at a minor cost</a></h6>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The first is <strong>success at a minor cost</strong>—a few
points of stress, story details about difficulty or complication but
aren’t hindrances themselves, and a boost (<strong>page XX</strong>) to the enemy are
all minor costs.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Ethan’s first few attempts all fail. By the time he actually gets the
door open, dawn has broken, and escape under cover of darkness is
impossible. He got what he needed, but his situation is worse now.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect5">
<h6 id="_partial_success"><a class="anchor" href="#_partial_success"></a><a class="link" href="#_partial_success">Partial Success</a></h6>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The other way to handle a tie is <strong>partial success</strong>—you succeeded but
only got some of what you wanted.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Ethan can only open the safe door a crack—if the door opens more than an
inch, the alarm will sound, and he can’t figure out how to disengage
that. He manages to pull a couple pages of the ritual out through the
narrow gap, but he’ll have to guess at the final steps.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_success"><a class="anchor" href="#_success"></a><a class="link" href="#_success">Success</a></h5>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The fiction <em>defines</em> what success looks like. What if Ethan didn’t have
the tools or experience needed to break into the safe? Perhaps that
success is more like our “minor cost” example above. Similarly, if Ethan
was on the team because he <em>built</em> the safe, that success might look
more like our “with style” example.</p>

<p>You can use the <strong>create an advantage</strong> action to
change the course of the story. By using your skills to introduce new
aspects or add invokes to existing aspects, you can stack the deck for
yourself and your teammates. You might change the circumstances (barring
a door or creating a plan), discover new information (learning a
monster’s weakness through research), or take advantage of something
already known (such as a CEO’s taste for scotch).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>An aspect created (or discovered) by creating an advantage works like
any other: It defines the narrative circumstances and can allow,
prevent, or impede actions—for instance, you cannot read a spell if the
room has been made <strong>Pitch Black</strong>. It can also be invoked (<strong>page XX</strong>) or
compelled (<strong>page XX</strong>). In addition, creating an advantage gives you one
or more <strong>free invokes</strong> of the created aspect. A free invoke, as the name
suggests, lets you invoke an aspect without spending a fate point. You
can even let your allies use free invokes you have created.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When you roll to create an advantage, specify whether you’re creating a
new aspect or taking advantage of an existing one. If the former, are
you attaching the aspect to an ally, opponent, or the environment? If
you’re attaching it to an opponent, they can take the defend action to
oppose you. Otherwise you’ll usually face a difficulty, but the GM can
decide if something or someone opposes your efforts with a defend roll

a moment.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Continuing from the previous example, the corpse gets to defend itself
against Ruth. The GM rolls [-][0][0][+], which doesn’t change the
creature’s Mediocre (+0) Athletics.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Because Ruth’s effort was higher, her attack succeeds by two shifts, and
the corpse is a little closer to being down for good. Had the corpse
rolled better, then its defense would have succeeded, and the undead
monstrosity would have avoided taking a hit.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>An <strong>aspect</strong> is a word or phrase that describes
something special about a person, place, thing, situation, or group.
Almost anything you can think of can have aspects. A person might have a
reputation as the <strong>Greatest Sharpshooter in the Wasteland</strong> (see below
for more about these kinds of aspects). A room might be <strong>On Fire</strong> after
you knock over an oil lamp. After an encounter with a monster, you might
be <strong>Terrified</strong>. Aspects let you change the story in ways that go along
with your character’s tendencies, skills, or problems.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_aspects_are_always_true"><a class="anchor" href="#_aspects_are_always_true"></a><a class="link" href="#_aspects_are_always_true">A.4.1. Aspects Are Always True</a></h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can invoke aspects for a bonus to a roll (<strong>page XX</strong>) and compel them
to create a complication (<strong>page XX</strong>). But even when those aren’t in
play, aspects still affect the narrative. When you have that
flesh-wrapped monstrosity <strong>Pinned in a Hydraulic Press</strong>, that is <em>true</em>.
It can’t do much stuck in there, and it’s not getting out easy.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In essence, “aspects are always true” means that <strong>aspects can grant or
withdraw permission for what can happen in the story</strong> (they can also
affect difficulty: see <strong>page XX</strong>). If the aforementioned monstrosity is
<strong>Pinned</strong>, the GM (and everyone else) has to respect that. The creature
has lost permission to move until something happens which removes that
aspect, either a successful overcome (which itself might require a
justifying aspect like <strong>Superhuman Strength</strong>) or someone foolishly
reversing the press. Similarly, if you have <strong>Cybernetically Enhanced
Legs</strong>, you’ve arguably gained permission to leap over walls in a single
bound without even having to roll for it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>That’s not to say you can create any aspect you want and use its truth
like a club. Aspects grant a lot of power to shape the story, yes, but
with that power comes the responsibility to play within the story’s
constraints. Aspects have to line up with the table’s sense of what
actually passes muster. <strong>If an aspect doesn’t pass the sniff test, it
needs to be reworded.</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Sure, you might <em>like</em> to use create an advantage to inflict the aspect
<strong>Dismembered</strong> on that fungal super-soldier, but that clearly steps on
the toes of the attack action, and besides, it takes a bit more work to
lop her arm off than that (could work as a consequence, though—see the
next page). You might <em>say</em> you’re the <strong>World’s Best Shot</strong>, but you’ll
need to back that up with your skills. And as much as you’d like to make
yourself <strong>Bulletproof</strong>, removing permission for someone to use small
arms fire to harm you, that is unlikely to fly unless the game you’re
playing involves using aspects-as-superpowers.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>There’s an endless variety of aspects (see <strong>page XX</strong> for more), but no
matter what they’re called, they all work pretty much the same way. The
main difference is how long they stick around before going away.</p>

<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_character_aspects"><a class="anchor" href="#_character_aspects"></a><a class="link" href="#_character_aspects">Character Aspects</a></h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>These aspects are on your character sheet, such as your high concept and
trouble. They describe personality traits, important details about your
past, relationships you have with others, important items or titles you
possess, problems you’re dealing with or goals you’re working toward, or
reputations and obligations you carry. These aspects primarily change
during milestones (<strong>page XX</strong>).</p>

<h5 id="_situation_aspects"><a class="anchor" href="#_situation_aspects"></a><a class="link" href="#_situation_aspects">Situation Aspects</a></h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>These aspects describe the surroundings or scenario where the action is
taking place. A situation aspect usually vanishes at the end of the
scene it was part of, or when someone takes some action that would
change or get rid of it. Essentially, they last only as long as the
situation they represent lasts.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Examples:</strong> <strong>On Fire; Bright Sunlight; Crowd of Angry People; Knocked to

<h5 id="_boosts"><a class="anchor" href="#_boosts"></a><a class="link" href="#_boosts">Boosts</a></h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A <strong>boost</strong> is a special kind of aspect,
representing an extremely temporary or minor situation. You cannot
compel a boost or spend a fate point to invoke it. You may invoke it
once for free, after which it vanishes. An unused boost vanishes when
the advantage it represents no longer exists, which may be a few seconds
or the duration of a single action. They never persist beyond the end of
a scene, and you can hold off naming one until you’re using it. If
you’re in control of a boost, you may pass it to an ally if there’s
rationale for it.</p>

<p>One way you can earn fate points is by letting your character’s aspects
be <strong>compelled</strong> (<strong>page XX</strong>) against you to complicate the situation or
make your life harder. You may also get a fate point payout if someone
uses your aspect against you in a hostile invoke (<strong>page XX</strong>) or when you
concede (<strong>page XX</strong>).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Remember, each session, you also start with fate points at least equal
to your <strong>refresh</strong>. If you were compelled more than you invoked in the
prior session, you’ll show up at the next one with more. See <strong>page XX</strong>

<p>To unlock the true power of aspects and make them help you, you’ll need
to spend <strong>fate points</strong> to
<strong>invoke</strong> them during dice rolls (<strong>page XX</strong>).
Keep track of your fate points with pennies or glass beads or poker
chips or some other tokens.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">

<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you want an easy way to ensure you have room to incorporate aspects
into a roll, try narrating your action with an ellipsis at the end
(“&#8230;&#8203;”), and then finish the action with the aspect you want to invoke.
Like this:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Ryan says, “So I’m trying to decipher the runes and&#8230;&#8203;” (rolls the dice,
hates the result) “&#8230;&#8203;and <strong>If I Haven’t Been There, I’ve Read About
It</strong>&#8230;&#8203;” (spends a fate point) “&#8230;&#8203;so I easily start rambling about their

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Most of the time an aspect is invoked, it’s a character aspect or a
situation aspect. Sometimes you’ll invoke enemies’ character aspects
<em>against</em> them. This is called a <strong>hostile
invocation</strong>, and it works just like invoking any other aspect—pay a
fate point and get a +2 to your roll or reroll the dice. There’s one
small difference—<strong>when you make a hostile invocation, you give the fate
point to the enemy.</strong> But they don’t get to use the fate point until
after the scene is over. This payout only applies when a fate point is
actually spent on a hostile invocation. Free invokes do not trigger a
payout.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>You may spend a fate point to add an important or unlikely detail to the
story based on an aspect in play. In cases where “aspects are always
true” (page XX) suffices, you do not need to spend the fate point;
paying is for when it’s a stretch.</p>

<h5 id="_compels"><a class="anchor" href="#_compels"></a><a class="link" href="#_compels">Compels</a></h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Aspects can be <strong>compelled</strong> to complicate the
situation and earn fate points. To compel an aspect, the GM or a player
offers a fate point to the player whose character is being compelled,
and tells them why an aspect is making things more difficult or
complicated. If you refuse the compel, you must spend a fate point from
your own supply and describe how your character avoids the complication.
Yes, this means that if you don’t have any fate points, you can’t refuse
a compel!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Any aspect can be compelled</strong>—whether it’s a character aspect, situation
aspect, or consequence—but it must be something that affects the
character being compelled.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Anyone can offer a compel.</strong> The player proposing the compel must spend
one of their own fate points. The GM then takes over running the compel
for the affected target. The GM does not lose a fate point by offering a
compel—they have a limited pool of fate points for invoking aspects, but
can compel as much as they’d like.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Compels can be retroactive.</strong> If a player finds they have roleplayed
themself into a complication related to one of their aspects or a
situation aspect that concerns them, they can ask the GM if that counts
as a <strong>self-compel</strong>. If the group agrees, the GM slides the player a fate
point.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>It’s okay to recognize a compel as off-the-mark and withdraw it.</strong> If
the group agrees that a proposed compel wasn’t appropriate, it should be
withdrawn at no cost to the compelled character.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>When offering a compel, make sure that the complication is a course of
action or major change in circumstance, not a denial of options.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>“Oh, you’ve got sand in your eyes, so you shoot at the creature and
miss,” is not a compel. It denies action rather than complicating
anything.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>“You know, curse your luck, I think that the sand in your eyes means you
can’t really see anything. Your shots at the shoggoth go wild,

the tension, and gives the players something new to think about.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are two general kinds of compels: <strong>events</strong> and <strong>decisions</strong>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>An event compel is something that happens to a character because of an
external force. That external force connects with the aspect in some
way, resulting in an unfortunate complication.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A decision compel is internal, where the character’s flaws or competing
values get in the way of better judgment. The aspect guides the
character to make a particular choice—and the fallout of that choice
creates a complication for them.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In either case, a resulting complication is key! Without a complication,
there is no compel.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Don’t confuse hostile invocations and compels! Though they are
similar—they are ways to give a character an immediate problem in
exchange for a fate point—they work differently.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A compel creates a <em>narrative change</em>. The decision to compel a
character’s aspect isn’t something that happens in-universe; rather,
it’s the GM or player proposing a change to the story. The effect can be
broad, but the target gets the fate point immediately if they accept the
compel, and may choose to refuse the compel.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A hostile invocation is a <em>mechanical effect</em>. The target doesn’t get a
chance to refuse the invocation—but as with any invocation, you will
need to explain how that aspect makes sense to invoke. And while they do
get a fate point, they don’t get to use it in the current scene.
However, the ultimate result is much more constrained: a +2 bonus or one
reroll of the dice.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Compels let you, as a player or GM, change what a scene is <em>about</em>. They
throw a wrench in the narrative. Using them against an opponent is a
risky proposition—they might refuse, or accomplish their objective
despite the complication thanks to the shiny new fate point you handed
them.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Hostile invocations help you in the current moment. In addition to your
own aspects, you have your opponent’s aspects available to invoke,
giving you more options and making scenes more dynamic and connected.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can create or discover a situation aspect using the create an
advantage action (<strong>page XX</strong>). You may also create boosts that way, or as
a result of a tie or success with style when you overcome an obstacle,
attack, or defend.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can remove an aspect provided you can think of a way your character
could do so—blast the <strong>Raging Fire</strong> with a fire extinguisher, use
evasive maneuvers to escape the pursuing guard that’s <strong>On Your Tail</strong>.
Depending on the situation, that might require an overcome action (<strong>page
XX</strong>); in this case, an opponent could use a defend action to try to
preserve the aspect, if they can describe how they do so.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>However, if there’s no narrative block to removing an aspect, you can
simply do so. If you’re <strong>All Tied Up</strong> and then a friend unties you, the
aspect goes away. If there’s nothing stopping you, there’s no need to
roll.</p>

<p>We’ve covered the standard aspect types on <strong>page XX</strong>. These additional
types are optional, but may add value to your game. To some extent these
are variants on character aspects (if you expand your notion of what
counts as a character) and situation aspects (if you change your notion
of how long those last).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Organization aspects:</strong> Sometimes you might be dealing with a whole
organization that operates under a certain set of principles. Consider
giving the organization aspects which any member of it can access as if
it were their own.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Scenario aspects:</strong> Sometimes a particular plot might introduce a new
“trope” that shows up time and again in the storyline. Consider defining
this as an aspect which is available to all characters in the story
until that part of the story concludes.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Setting aspects:</strong> Like a scenario aspect, the setting of your campaign
itself may have recurring themes. Unlike a scenario aspect, these
aspects don’t go away.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Zone aspects:</strong> You can attach situation aspects to a particular place
on the map represented by a zone (<strong>page XX</strong>). This can add extra
dynamism to your group’s interactions with the map. A GM can encourage
this by making an “up for grabs” free invoke available on a zone aspect
at the start of the scene, drawing characters (player and non-player
alike) to leverage that aspect as part of their early strategy.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Many times, you will be able to resolve an action with a single roll of
the dice—do you crack the safe, avoid security, or convince the reporter
to give you their notes? Other times you’ll face extended engagements
that take many rolls to resolve. For those cases, we offer three
resolution tools: <strong>challenges</strong>, <strong>contests</strong>, and <strong>conflicts</strong>. Each does
things a little differently, depending on the goal of the engagement and
the opposition involved.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>A challenge is a complicated or dynamic situation.</strong> You’ll be opposed
by someone or something, but there isn’t a dominant “other side.” This
is how you might play out a researcher looking for clues in an ancient
tome, the party negotiator distracting the librarian, and the bruiser
holding back untold horrors from entering the library all at the same
time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>A contest is a situation where two parties are pursuing mutually
exclusive goals, but not actively harming one another.</strong> Contests are
perfect for chases, debates, and races of all sorts. (And just because
the parties are not trying to harm each other doesn’t mean that harm
can’t befall them!)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>A conflict is when characters can and want to harm one another.</strong>
Wrestling in the mud with a cultist as knives stab at bellies, riddling
a swarm of ghouls with bullets as their claws rake at your flesh, and an
exchange of vicious barbs with your rival under the watchful eye of the
queen—these are all conflicts.</p>

<h4 id="_setting_up_scenes"><a class="anchor" href="#_setting_up_scenes"></a><a class="link" href="#_setting_up_scenes">A.5.1. Setting Up Scenes</a></h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Regardless of the type of scene, the GM will start by setting the
essential pieces into place, so that the players know what resources are
available and what complications are in play.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_zones"><a class="anchor" href="#_zones"></a><a class="link" href="#_zones">Zones</a></h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Zones</strong> are a representation of the physical space—a quick map broken
into a few discrete sections. A conflict in a remote farmhouse might
have four zones: the first floor, second floor, front yard, and back
woods. Two to four zones are sufficient to handle most conflicts. Large
or complicated scenes may require more. Try to keep your zone map to a
simple sketch, something that fits on a note card or can be quickly
drawn on a whiteboard.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Zones help guide the story by shaping what is possible. Who you can
attack and where you can move depend on the zone you’re in.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Anyone in a zone can interact with everyone and everything in that
zone.</strong> This means you can hit, stab, or otherwise physically engage with
people and things in your zone. Need to open that wall safe in the
bedroom? You’ll have to be in that zone. Anything outside your zone is
usually beyond your reach—you’ll need to move to get there, or use
something that can extend your reach there (telekinesis, a gun, etc).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Moving between zones is easy, as long as there’s nothing in your way.
<strong>You can move to an adjacent zone in addition to your action during an
exchange (</strong><strong>page XX</strong><strong>) as long as nothing is in your way.</strong> If your
movement is impeded, it takes your action to do so. Make an overcome
roll to climb a wall, rush past a group of cultists, or leap across
rooftops. If you fail, you stay in your zone or the movement costs you
something. You can also use your action to move <em>anywhere</em> on the
map—though the GM is within rights to set a high difficulty if it’s an
epic movement.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If something isn’t risky or interesting enough to merit a roll, then it
isn’t an impediment to movement. For instance, you don’t need to use up
your action opening an unlocked door—that’s just a part of the movement.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Shooting lets you attack from a distance. Ranged attacks can target
enemies in adjacent zones or maybe further, if the zones are clear
enough. If there’s a creature rooting around in the bedroom upstairs and
around the corner, you can’t shoot it from the bottom of the stairs. Pay
attention to the way the zones and situation aspects are set up when
deciding what’s fair game or not.</p>

</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="situation-aspects"><a class="anchor" href="#situation-aspects"></a><a class="link" href="#situation-aspects">Situation Aspects</a></h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When setting the scene, the GM should think of interesting and dynamic
environmental features that can constrain the action or provide
opportunities to change the situation by using them. Three to five
details are more than enough. Use these categories as a guide:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Tone, mood, or weather</strong>—darkness, lightning, and howling winds</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Impediments to movement</strong>—connected by ladders, covered in slime, and
filled with smoke</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Cover and obstructions</strong>—vehicles, pillars, and crates</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Dangerous features</strong>—crates of TNT, barrels of oil, and eldritch
artifacts crackling with electricity</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Usable objects</strong>—improvised weapons, statues or bookshelves to knock
over, and doors to be barred</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Anyone can invoke and compel these aspects, so remember to take them
into account when you wrestle that cultist to the ground amid the
<strong>Caustic Slime Covering Everything</strong>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>More situation aspects can be written down as the scene plays out. If it
makes sense that there are <strong>Deep Shadows</strong> in the recesses of the
catacombs, go ahead and write that down when a player asks if there are
any shadows they can use to hide. Other aspects come into play because
characters use the create an advantage action. Things like <strong>Flames
Everywhere!</strong> don’t just happen without character action. Well. Usually.</p>

<p>It’s up to the GM to decide if a situation aspect arising from the
scene’s setup provides a free invoke to the players (or even to the
NPCs). Some of the scene’s aspects might provide a clever player just
the advantage they need right away—and a free invoke can be a strong
incentive to drive players to interact with the environment. Free
invokes also might end up on the scene’s aspects at the start due to
preparations made in advance.</p>

<h5 id="_turn_order"><a class="anchor" href="#_turn_order"></a><a class="link" href="#_turn_order">Turn Order</a></h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Often, you won’t need to know who is acting precisely when, but in
contests and conflicts turn order can become important. These scenes
take place over a series of <strong>exchanges</strong>. In an
exchange, each involved character can take one overcome, create an
advantage, or attack action, and can move once. (Contests work slightly
differently; see <strong>page XX</strong>.) Because defending is a reaction to someone
else’s action, characters can defend as many times as they need to
during other characters’ turns, so long as they can justify their
ability to interfere based on what’s already been established in the
story.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>At the start of a scene, the GM and players decide who goes first based
on the situation, then the active player picks who goes next. The GM’s
characters are selected in the turn order just like the PCs, with the GM
deciding who goes next after the NPCs have acted. After everyone has
taken a turn, the last player picks who goes next at the start of the
next exchange.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Cassandra and Ruth have stumbled across a small group of cultists, led
by an acolyte in a golden mask, performing some arcane ritual. Because
the cultists are focused on their work, the GM declares that the PCs
will go first in this conflict. The players decide that Cassandra will
act first: she creates an advantage against the masked cultist,
<strong>Distracted</strong>, by running directly at them screaming. It’s crude but
effective. To make the best use of the situation aspect, Cassandra’s
player decides that Ruth should go next. Ruth throws a dagger at the
masked acolyte, and immediately invokes <strong>Distracted</strong> to improve her
attack. It’s not enough to take out the acolyte in one hit, but it is a
one-two punch that leaves the cultist reeling.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Unfortunately, now that all the PCs in the scene have acted, Ruth has no
choice but to pick one of the cultists to go next. She chooses the
masked acolyte. The GM smiles, because they know that once the acolyte
acts, she can have the cultists act until the end of the round, at which
point they can choose the masked acolyte to start the next exchange. The
PCs may have gotten a good first hit in, but now the cultists get to
fight back.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This method of determining turn order goes by several names in online
discussion: elective action order, and “popcorn,” “handoff,” or “Balsera
Style” initiative, the last one named after Fate Core author Leonard
Balsera, who planted the seed of the idea. You can learn more about this
method and its strategies at

<h4 id="_teamwork"><a class="anchor" href="#_teamwork"></a><a class="link" href="#_teamwork">A.5.2. Teamwork</a></h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Fate offers three methods for teamwork: combining the same skill from
multiple characters on a single roll, stacking free invokes by creating
advantages to set up a team member for success, and invoking aspects on
an ally’s behalf.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When you combine skills, figure out who has the highest level in the
skill among the participants. Each other participant who has at least
Average (+1) in that skill adds a +1 to the highest person’s skill
level. Providing support like this uses your action for the exchange.
Supporters face the same costs and consequences as the person making the
roll. The maximum total bonus a team may provide this way is equal to
the highest person’s skill level.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Otherwise, you can create an advantage on your turn and let an ally use
the free invokes when it makes sense that they can. Outside of your
turn, you may invoke an aspect to add a bonus to someone else’s roll.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_challenges"><a class="anchor" href="#_challenges"></a><a class="link" href="#_challenges">A.5.3. Challenges</a></h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Many of the difficulties your characters face can be handled with a
single roll in the course of a scene—disarm the bomb, find the tome of
eldritch lore, or decode the cypher. But sometimes things are more
fluid, more complicated, and it’s just not as simple as finding the tome
of eldritch lore because the yacht you’re searching is careening through
Hong Kong harbor while a monsoon rages outside and the boat’s library is
on fire—which is totally not your fault.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In complicated circumstances with no opposition, you’ll want to use a
<strong>challenge</strong>: a series of overcome actions that tackle a bigger issue.
Challenges let the entire group work together in a scene, and they keep
things dynamic.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To set up a challenge, the GM considers the situation and picks a number
of skills that can contribute to the success of the group. Treat each
action as a separate overcome roll.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>GMs, do your best to give each character in the scene an opportunity to
contribute—aim for a number of skills equal to the number of characters
involved. If you expect to have some of the characters pulled away or
distracted by other priorities, downsize accordingly. For more difficult
challenges, build the challenge with more needed actions than there are
characters, in addition to adjusting the difficulties of the actions.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>After the rolls have been made, the GM will evaluate the successes,
failures, and costs of each action as they interpret how the scene
proceeds. It could be that the results lead into another challenge, a
contest, or even a conflict. A mix of successes and failures should
allow the characters to move forward with a partial victory as they face
new entangling complications.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_contests"><a class="anchor" href="#_contests"></a><a class="link" href="#_contests">A.5.4. Contests</a></h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A <strong>contest</strong> is when two or more sides are in direct opposition but there
isn’t a conflict. This doesn’t mean one side doesn’t <em>want</em> to hurt the
other. Contests may involve the group trying to escape or counteract
danger (such as an erupting volcano or angry god) before the danger cuts
off any chance of victory.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>At the start of a contest, everyone involved declares their intent, what
they hope to get out of it. If there are multiple PCs involved, they can
be on the same or different sides, depending on their goals—<em>e.g.,</em> in a
foot race, each character might be on their own side. <strong>If the PCs can’t
or aren’t trying to harm the enemy, the GM can still declare a goal of
harming or killing the PCs.</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Contests take place over a series of exchanges (<strong>page XX</strong>), during which
each side will take an overcome action to do something to achieve their
goals. Only one character on each side takes the overcome action in each
exchange, but their allies can provide teamwork and try to create
advantages to assist (which comes with some risk—see below). The
overcome actions can be against passive difficulties—if the contestants
are facing separate environmental challenges—or compared against one
another when they’re in direct competition.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>At the end of each exchange, compare the efforts of each side’s action.
The side with the highest effort marks a <strong>victory</strong>. If the victor
succeeds with style—and no one else did—then they mark <strong>two</strong> victories.
The first one to three victories wins the contest. (You can always
decide instead to run an extended contest requiring more victories,
though we recommend no more than five.)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When there’s a tie for the highest effort, no one marks a victory, and
an <strong>unexpected twist</strong> happens. The GM will introduce a new situation
aspect to reflect how the scene, terrain, or situation has changed.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In contests where something is trying to harm any of the contestants,
the PCs take hits whenever the opposition beats them in an exchange. The
hit has shifts equal to the shifts of failure, just as if they were in a
conflict. Just like in a conflict, if a character can’t absorb all the
shifts of a hit, they are taken out.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>During any exchange, your side can try to create advantages before
making your overcome roll. If you’re targeting another participant, they
get to defend. If someone can interfere, they may oppose it with a
defend roll as normal. Each participant may attempt to create an
advantage in addition to rolling or providing a teamwork bonus (<strong>page
XX</strong>). If you fail to create an advantage, you have a choice: either your
side forfeits its overcome roll, or you may “succeed at a cost”
(preserving your roll or teamwork bonus) by giving the other side a free
invoke instead. If you at least tie, proceed as normal with your roll or
bonus.</p>

<h4 id="_conflicts"><a class="anchor" href="#_conflicts"></a><a class="link" href="#_conflicts">A.5.5. Conflicts</a></h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When the heroes get into a straight-up fight—whether with the
authorities, cultists, or some unspeakable horror—and can win, you have
a <strong>conflict</strong>. In other words, use conflicts when violence or coercion is
a reasonable means to the ends of the PCs.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Conflicts may seem the most straightforward—after all, the history of
roleplaying games is built on combat simulators. But keep in mind a key
part of their description: the characters involved have the capability
to harm <em>each other</em>. If it’s one-sided—say you’re trying to punch a
living mountain—there’s no chance you can hurt it. That’s not a
conflict. That’s a contest, probably where the PCs are trying to escape
or find the means to fight back.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Conflicts can be physical or mental. Physical conflicts can be
shoot-outs, sword-fights, or ramming extradimensional beings with
trucks. Mental conflicts include arguments with loved ones,
interrogations, and eldritch assaults upon the mind.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_taking_harm"><a class="anchor" href="#_taking_harm"></a><a class="link" href="#_taking_harm">Taking Harm</a></h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When an attack is successful, the defender must
absorb the hit, which has shifts equal to the difference between the
attack’s effort and defense’s effort.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can absorb shifts of a hit by marking stress boxes and by taking
consequences. If you can’t or don’t absorb all of the shifts, you are
<strong>taken out</strong> (<strong>page XX</strong>)—you’re removed from the scene, and the attacker
decides how it plays out.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A series of regrettable decisions has put Charles in a dank basement,
confronting a ghoul that very much wants to eat him. The ghoul attacks,
lunging with its sharp claws; this is an attack using its Fair (2)
Fight. The GM rolls [0][0][][+], bringing the effort up to Great (+4).
Charles tries to leap out of the way with his Good (+3) Athletics, but
rolls [0][0][0][-], taking his effort down to Fair (+2). Because the
ghoul’s attack effort was two steps higher than Charles’s defense
effort, Charles must absorb two shifts. He marks the first two of his
three physical stress boxes; already the fight is proving dangerous.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect5">
<h6 id="_stress"><a class="anchor" href="#_stress"></a><a class="link" href="#_stress">Stress</a></h6>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Simply put, <strong>stress</strong> is plot armor. It’s a
resource used to keep your character up and in the fight when their foes
hit them. When you mark stress boxes to absorb a hit, you’re saying
things like, “That <em>just</em> missed me,” or “Whoa, that knocked the wind
out of me but I’m okay.” That said, it’s a limited resource—most
characters only have three boxes for physical stress and three boxes for
mental stress, though characters with high Will or Physique have more.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You’ll find two <strong>stress tracks</strong> on your character sheet, one for
physical harm and one for mental harm. When you take a hit, you can mark
empty stress boxes of the appropriate type to absorb it and stay in the
fight. Each stress box you mark absorbs one shift. You can mark multiple
stress boxes if you need to.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The boxes are binary—either they’re empty and can be used or they’re
full and can’t. That’s okay, though. You’ll clear the stress track as
soon as you make it through the scene—provided the monsters don’t eat
you first.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect5">
<h6 id="consequences"><a class="anchor" href="#consequences"></a><a class="link" href="#consequences">Consequences</a></h6>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Consequences</strong> are new aspects you write on your
character sheet when your character takes a hit, representing the real
harm and injury your character suffers.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When you take a consequence to absorb a hit, write an aspect in an empty
consequence slot that describes what harm befalls your character. Use
the severity of the consequence as a guide: If you were bitten by star
spawn, a mild consequence might be <strong>Nasty Bite</strong>, but a moderate
consequence could be <strong>Bite That Won’t Stop Bleeding</strong>, and a severe
consequence might be <strong>Crippled Leg</strong>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>While stress turns a hit into a near miss, taking a consequence means
you got hit hard. Why would you take a consequence? Because sometimes
stress isn’t enough. Remember, you have to absorb <em>all</em> the shifts of
the hit to stay in the fight. You only have so many stress boxes. The
good news is that consequences can take pretty big hits.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Each character starts with three consequence slots—mild, moderate, and
severe. Taking a minor consequence absorbs two shifts, a moderate one
absorbs four shifts, and a severe one absorbs six shifts.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So, if you take a big five-shift hit, you can absorb the whole thing
with a single stress box and a moderate consequence. That’s a lot more
efficient than spending five of your stress boxes.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The downside to consequences is that they are aspects—and aspects are
always true (<strong>page XX</strong>). So if you’ve got <strong>Gut Shot</strong>, your character’s
gut is shot! That will mean you can’t do things a gut-shot person can’t
do (like run fast). If things get particularly complicated due to this,
you might even face a compel on your consequence, too. And, just like
the aspects you make when you create an advantage, the character that
created the consequence—that is, whoever shot you—gets one free invoke
on that consequence. Ouch!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Charles is still battling the ghoul. It claws at him, this time rolling
a [0][0][][], adding its Fair (+2) Fight, and invokes its <strong>Hungry for
Flesh</strong> aspect for an additional +2, adding up to a devastating Fantastic
(+6) blow. Charles’s [-][-][0][0], added to his Good (+3) Athletics,
gives him a merely Average (+1) defense; that’s five shifts he needs to
absorb. He chooses to take a moderate consequence. His player and the GM
decide that the ghoul gave Charles a <strong>Gaping Chest Wound</strong>. This
consequence absorbs four of the shifts, leaving one, which Charles
absorbs with his last remaining stress box.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect5">
<h6 id="_getting_taken_out"><a class="anchor" href="#_getting_taken_out"></a><a class="link" href="#_getting_taken_out">Getting Taken Out</a></h6>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you can’t absorb all the shifts of a hit with stress and
consequences, you’re <strong>taken out</strong>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Getting taken out is bad. Whoever took you out decides what happens.
Given dangerous situations and powerful enemies, this could mean you’re
dead, but that’s not the only possibility. The outcome must be in
keeping with the scope and scale of the conflict at hand—you won’t die
of shame if you lose an argument—but changes to your character sheet
(and more) are possible. The outcome should also fit within the
boundaries your group has established—if your group feels that
characters should never get killed without the player’s consent, that’s
perfectly valid.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But even when death is on the table (it’s best to be clear about that
before a roll), GMs should remember that it’s usually a boring result. A
PC that’s been taken out could be lost, kidnapped, imperiled, be forced
to take consequences… the list goes on. A character’s death means
someone has to make a new character and bring them into the story, but a
fate worse than death is limited only by your imagination.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Follow the fiction when describing how someone—or something—is taken
out. Was a cultist taken out by a barrage of machine gun fire? A spray
of red fills the air as they slump with a wet thump to the ground. Were
you hurled from the truck as it crossed the 26th Street overpass? You
disappear over the edge and are left behind as the conflict rumbles on
along the Dan Ryan. Keep death in mind when discussing the terms of
being taken out, but often it’s just as interesting to cheat death.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The ghoul gets in a very lucky hit, dealing a Legendary (+8) attack
against Charles’s Poor (-1) defense. By this point in the conflict, all
of Charles’s stress boxes are full, as is his moderate consequence slot.
Even if he were to take a mild and a severe consequence at once,
absorbing eight shifts, it wouldn’t be enough. As a result, Charles is
taken out. The ghoul gets to decide his fate. The GM would be within
their rights to have the ghoul kill Charles then and there…but getting
killed isn’t the most interesting result.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Instead, the GM declares that Charles survives, getting knocked out and
dragged to the ghoul’s lair, consequences intact. Charles will wake up
lost and very fragile in the pitch-dark catacombs beneath the city.
Because he was taken out, Charles has no choice but to accept the terms
laid before him.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect5">
<h6 id="_conceding"><a class="anchor" href="#_conceding"></a><a class="link" href="#_conceding">Conceding</a></h6>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So how do you keep from dying horribly—or worse? You can interrupt any
action in a conflict to <strong>concede</strong> as long as
the dice haven’t hit the table yet. Just give in. Tell everyone that
you’re done, that you can’t keep going. Your character loses and exits
the conflict, but <strong>you gain a fate point</strong> plus an extra one for each
consequence they took in the current conflict.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Also, concession means <em>you</em> declare the terms of your loss and how you
exit the conflict. You can escape the monsters and live to fight another
day. It is a loss, though. You’ll have to give your foe something they
want. You can’t concede and describe how you heroically save the
day—that’s not on the table anymore.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Conceding is a powerful tool. You can concede to escape with an action
plan for the next fight, a clue as to where to go, or some advantage
going forward. You just can’t win <em>this</em> fight.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You must concede before your opponent rolls the dice. You can’t wait to
see the outcome of the dice and concede when it’s obvious you can’t
win—that’s poor form.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Some negotiation is expected, here. Look for a solution that works for
everyone at the table. If the opposition isn’t on board with the terms
of your concession, they can push for rewording those terms, or ask that
you sacrifice something different or extra. Because a concession is
still a loss for you, that does mean the other side should gain at least
part of what they’re after.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The more significant the cost you pay, the greater the benefit your side
should receive as part of the concession—if certain doom is about to
befall the entire group, one member choosing to concede as a heroic (and
fatal) last stand could mean everyone else is spared!</p>

<p>To start the <strong>recovery process</strong>, the person treating you will need to

means she’d have four Fair (+2) skills and only three Average (+1)…that
won’t do. Luckily, she has saved a second skill point from an earlier
milestone, so she also increases her Mediocre (+0) Empathy to Average
(+1). Now she has one Great (+4), two Good (+3), four Fair (+2), and
four Average (+1) skills.</p>

<h4 id="_sessions_and_arcs"><a class="anchor" href="#_sessions_and_arcs"></a><a class="link" href="#_sessions_and_arcs">A.6.3. Sessions and Arcs</a></h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are a few assumptions at play here where we talk about sessions
and arcs. We’d like to shine some light on those assumptions so you can
make adjustments based on how your game differs from them.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A <strong>session</strong> is a single session of play comprised of several scenes and
a few hours of gameplay. Think of this as similar to a single episode of
a television show. It likely falls into the three-to-four hour range.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>An <strong>arc</strong> is a series of sessions that often contain plot elements that
carry over from session to session. Those plot elements don’t have to
conclude within an arc, but there are usually significant developments
and changes that come about over the course of it. Think of this as
similar to a third- or half-season of a television show. It’s likely
comprised of about four sessions of play.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If your gameplay falls outside of those “likely” ranges, you may want to
change how some parts of the milestones work. If your arcs run more than
four to six sessions of play, you may want to allow Severe consequences
to clear after four sessions pass rather than waiting until the end of
the arc. If you want advancement to happen more slowly, you might allow
improvements like skill points and refresh gains less often. If your
group tends to schedule fairly short sessions, you might not hit a minor
milestone at the end of every session. Season to taste; the game is
yours to shape!</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_being_the_game_master"><a class="anchor" href="#_being_the_game_master"></a><a class="link" href="#_being_the_game_master">A.7. Being the Game Master</a></h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As the GM, you are the director of game sessions. Note that you are not
the <em>boss.</em> <em>Fate Condensed</em> is collaborative, and the players have say
in what happens to their characters. Your job is to keep things moving
by doing these things:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Run scenes:</strong> A session is made up of scenes. Decide where the scene
begins, who’s there, and what’s going on. Decide when all the
interesting things have played out and the scene’s over. Skip over the
unnecessary stuff; in the same way that you don’t roll dice if the
outcome of an action won’t be interesting, don’t have a scene if nothing
exciting, dramatic, useful, or fun will happen during it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Adjudicate the rules:</strong> When some question comes up about how to apply
the rules, you can discuss it with the players and try to reach an
agreeable consensus, but you get final say.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Set difficulty:</strong> Decide when rolls are necessary and set their
difficulties.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Determine the costs of failure:</strong> When a character fails their roll,
you decide what the cost of success at a cost will be. You can certainly
take suggestions from the player—they may know just how they want their
character to get hurt—but you ultimately decide.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Play the NPCs:</strong> Each player controls their own character, but you
control all the rest, from cultists to monsters to the Big Bad itself.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Give the PCs opportunities for action:</strong> If the players don’t know
what to do next, it’s your job to give them a nudge. Never let things
get too bogged down in indecision or lack of information—do something to
shake things up. When in doubt, think about your Big Bad’s tactics and
goals to create a spot of bother for the heroes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Make sure everyone gets the spotlight:</strong> Your goal isn’t to defeat the
players, but to challenge them. Make sure each PC gets a chance to be
the star once in a while. Spread around compels and challenges tailored
to the characters’ different abilities and weaknesses.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Complicate the PCs’ lives:</strong> In addition to throwing monsters at the
characters, you will be the primary source of compels. Players can
compel themselves and other characters, of course, but you must ensure
that everyone gets opportunities to experience the negative
repercussions of their aspects.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Build off player choices:</strong> Look at the actions the PCs have taken
during play and think about how the world changes and responds. Make the
world feel alive by presenting the PCs with those consequences—good and
bad—in play.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_setting_difficulty_and_opposition"><a class="anchor" href="#_setting_difficulty_and_opposition"></a><a class="link" href="#_setting_difficulty_and_opposition">A.7.1. Setting Difficulty and Opposition</a></h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Sometimes, a PC’s action will face <strong>opposition</strong> via a defend roll from
another character in the scene. In this case, the opposing character
rolls dice and adds their relevant skill rating, just like the PC. If
the opposing character has relevant aspects, they can be invoked; the GM
can invoke NPCs’ aspects using the fate point in their pool (<strong>page XX</strong>).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But if there’s no opposition, you have to decide on the <strong>difficulty</strong> of
the action:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Low difficulties</strong>, below the PC’s relevant skill rating, are best
when you want to give them a chance to show off.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Moderate difficulties</strong>, near the PC’s relevant skill rating, are best
when you want to provide tension but not overwhelm them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>High difficulties</strong>, much higher than the PC’s relevant skill rating,
are best when you want to emphasize how dire or unusual the
circumstances are and make them pull out all the stops, or put them in a
position where they will need to suffer the consequences of failure.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Likewise, use the adjective ladder (<strong>page XX</strong>) of ratings to help you
choose an appropriate difficulty. Is it superbly difficult? Then pick
Superb (+5)! Here are a few rules of thumb to get you started.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If the task isn’t very tough at all, make it Mediocre (+0)—or just tell
the player they succeed without a roll, as long as there’s no serious
time pressure or the character has an aspect that suggests they’d be
good at it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you can think of at least one reason why the task is tough, pick Fair
(+2); for every extra factor working against them, add another +2 to the
difficulty.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When thinking about those factors, consult what aspects are in play.
When something is important enough to be made an aspect, it should get a
little attention here. Since aspects are true (<strong>page XX</strong>), they might
have influence over how easy or difficult something should be. That
doesn’t mean that aspects are the only factors to consider, of course!
Darkness is darkness regardless of whether or not you decided to make it
an aspect on the scene.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If the task is impossibly difficult, go as high as you think makes
sense. The PC will need to drop some fate points and get lots of help to
succeed, but that’s fine.</p>

<h4 id="_npcs"><a class="anchor" href="#_npcs"></a><a class="link" href="#_npcs">A.7.2. NPCs</a></h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>NPCs include bystanders, supporting cast, allies, foes, monsters, and
pretty much anything else that might complicate or oppose the efforts of
the PCs. You will probably want to create other characters for the PCs
to interact with.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_major_npcs"><a class="anchor" href="#_major_npcs"></a><a class="link" href="#_major_npcs">Major NPCs</a></h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If someone is particularly important to the story, you can stat them out
just like a PC. This is appropriate for someone who the PCs will deal
with a lot, such as an ally, a rival, the representative of a powerful
group, or a Big Bad.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A major NPC doesn’t necessarily follow the same limits as a starting PC.
If the NPC is going to be a recurring boss-level threat, give them a
higher peak skill (see <em>Setting Difficulty and Opposition</em> on <strong>page
XX</strong>), more stunts, and whatever else it takes to make them a danger.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_minor_npcs"><a class="anchor" href="#_minor_npcs"></a><a class="link" href="#_minor_npcs">Minor NPCs</a></h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>NPCs that aren’t going to be major, recurring characters don’t need to
be nearly as well-defined as major NPCs. For a minor NPC, only define
what is absolutely necessary.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Most minor NPCs will have a single aspect, which is just what they are:
<strong>Guard Dog</strong>, <strong>Obstructive Bureaucrat</strong>, or <strong>Enraged Cultist</strong>, etc.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If necessary, give them another aspect or two to reflect something
interesting about them or a weakness. They may also have a stunt.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Give them one or two skills to describe what they’re good at. You can
use skills from the skill list or make up something more specific, like
Fair (+2) at Getting into Bar Fights or Great (+4) at Biting People.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Give them zero to three stress boxes; the more they have, the more of a
threat they can be. Generally, they have no consequence slots; if they
take a hit with more shifts than they can absorb with stress, they are
simply taken out. Minor NPCs aren’t meant to stick around.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_monsters_big_bads_and_other_threats"><a class="anchor" href="#_monsters_big_bads_and_other_threats"></a><a class="link" href="#_monsters_big_bads_and_other_threats">Monsters, Big Bads, and Other Threats</a></h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Like minor NPCs, monsters and other threats (like a storm, a spreading
fire, or a squad of armored minions) are written up as characters, but
are usually simpler than a PC. You only need to define what is
absolutely necessary. Unlike minor NPCs, these threats can be defined
really in any way. Break the rules. Give them whatever combination of
aspects, skills, stunts, stress, and consequences it will take to make
them dangerous, and think about what sort of difficulties they will
present to the PCs when determining their ratings.</p>

<h4 id="_your_fate_points"><a class="anchor" href="#_your_fate_points"></a><a class="link" href="#_your_fate_points">A.7.3. Your Fate Points</a></h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>At the start of each scene, begin with a pool of
fate points equal to the number of PCs. If the scene includes a major
NPC or monster that conceded (<strong>page XX</strong>) a previous conflict, or
received hostile invokes (<strong>page XX</strong>) in a previous scene, those fate
points are added to your pool. If you received a compel in the prior
scene that ended that scene, giving you no opportunity to spend the
earned fate point, you may add that point to your pool as well.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Charles, Ruth, Cassandra, and Ethan are headed for the final
confrontation with Alice Westforth. Previously, she escaped from the
heroes by conceding a conflict after she had taken a moderate
consequence. That means the GM gets four fate points for the PCs and two
more that Alice is bringing along.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As the GM, you can spend fate points from this pool to invoke aspects,
refuse compels that the players offer NPCs, and use any NPC stunts that
require you to—all exactly as the players do.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>However, you do <em>not</em> need to spend fate points to compel any aspects.</strong>
You have an infinite supply of fate points for that purpose.</p>

<h4 id="_safety_tools"><a class="anchor" href="#_safety_tools"></a><a class="link" href="#_safety_tools">A.7.4. Safety Tools</a></h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>GMs (and truly, players as well) have a responsibility to ensure that
everyone at the table feels safe in the game and space they’re playing.
One way a GM can support this is by offering a framework for anyone at
the table to voice a concern or objection. When this happens, it must
take priority and must be addressed. Here are some tools that can help
make that process more available to the players at the table and more
easy to enact when necessary.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>The X-Card:</strong> The X-Card is an optional tool (created by John
Stavropoulos) that allows anyone in your game (including you) to edit
out any content anyone is uncomfortable with as you play. You can learn
more about the X-Card at <a href="http://tinyurl.com/x-card-rpg" class="bare">http://tinyurl.com/x-card-rpg</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Script Change RPG Toolbox:</strong> For something with a bit more nuance and
granularity, look to Script Change by Brie Beau Sheldon, which provides
options to pause, rewind, skip ahead, and more using an accessibly
familiar media-player metaphor. Learn more about Script Change at
<a href="http://tinyurl.com/nphed7m" class="bare">http://tinyurl.com/nphed7m</a></p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Tools like these may also be used like the bogus rule (<strong>page XX</strong>) for
calibration. They offer a way for players to comfortably advocate for
what they’re looking for in the game. Give such tools the respect and
support they deserve!</p>

<h3 id="_optional_rules"><a class="anchor" href="#_optional_rules"></a><a class="link" href="#_optional_rules">A.8. Optional rules</a></h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>These are a few optional or alternative rules you can decide to use in your game.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_conditions"><a class="anchor" href="#_conditions"></a><a class="link" href="#_conditions">A.8.1. Conditions</a></h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Conditions</strong> are a substitute for consequences, and replace them
entirely. Conditions serve two purposes: they take some of the pressure
off of the players and GM to quickly figure out a correctly-worded
aspect for an inflicted consequence, and they give you an opportunity to
shape the nature of your game by pre-defining the ways lasting harm
befalls characters.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <em>Fate Condensed</em> version of conditions takes each consequence level
and splits it into two conditions of half the value.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>[1]</strong> <strong>Hurt</strong> (Mild) <strong>[1]</strong> <strong>Scared</strong> (Mild)<br>
<strong>[2]</strong> <strong>Injured</strong> (Moderate) <strong>[2]</strong> <strong>Shaken</strong> (Moderate)<br>
<strong>[3]</strong> <strong>Wounded</strong> (Severe) <strong>[3]</strong> <strong>Demoralized</strong> (Severe)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>These correspond to physical and mental states—but just because you’ve
taken a physical hit doesn’t mean you can’t also mark a mental
condition, and vice-versa, so long as it makes sense. Attacks are
traumatic!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Conditions are recovered just like consequences, based on their
severity.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you would gain an additional mild consequence, instead gain two more
boxes on either <strong>Hurt</strong> or <strong>Scared</strong>, as appropriate.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_moving_conditions_further_apart"><a class="anchor" href="#_moving_conditions_further_apart"></a><a class="link" href="#_moving_conditions_further_apart">Moving Conditions Further Apart</a></h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you would prefer instead to keep physical and mental conditions
separate, double the number of boxes on each. That said, there is a
cutoff: if two boxes total are marked on either condition in a row, no
more boxes may be marked on that row. So if you had one box (out of two)
marked on <strong>Hurt</strong> and none on <strong>Scared</strong>, and then marked either the second
<strong>Hurt</strong> box or first <strong>Scared</strong> box, you would no longer be able to mark
any more boxes on that row.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you would gain a mild consequence slot (from high Physique, Will, or
a stunt), instead add two more boxes of <strong>Hurt</strong> or <strong>Scared</strong> as
appropriate. These added boxes increase the cutoff threshold for that
row, one for one.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_other_versions_of_conditions"><a class="anchor" href="#_other_versions_of_conditions"></a><a class="link" href="#_other_versions_of_conditions">Other Versions of Conditions</a></h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Several published Fate-based games use conditions instead of
consequences. Feel free to adopt their implementation instead of this
one if it better suits you. Each one achieves much the same purpose for
the game: reducing pressure to figure out consequence aspects on the
fly, and guiding the nature of the game by limiting the kinds of lasting
harm characters can take.</p>

<h4 id="_changing_the_skill_list"><a class="anchor" href="#_changing_the_skill_list"></a><a class="link" href="#_changing_the_skill_list">A.8.2. Changing the Skill List</a></h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As mentioned on <strong>page XX</strong> skill lists are the first thing to consider
tinkering with when making your own Fate game. Our default skill setup
presents a list of 19 skills arranged in a pyramid of 10. That list is
also structured around a traditional notion of capabilities in various
fields of action, in essence addressing the question “what can you do?”
Other skill lists aren’t necessarily the same length, arranged the same
way, or addressing the same question. With that said, here are some
short skill lists to consider, borrow, and modify.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Actions:</strong> Endure, Fight, Know, Move, Notice, Pilot, Sneak, Speak,
Tinker.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Approaches:</strong> Careful, Clever, Flashy, Forceful, Quick, Sneaky.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Aptitudes:</strong> Athletics, Combat, Leadership, Scholarship, Subterfuge.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Attributes:</strong> Strength, Dexterity, Toughness, Intelligence, Charm.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Relationships:</strong> Leading, Partnering, Supporting, Solo.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Roles:</strong> Driver, Hitter, Hacker, Gearhead, Grifter, Thief, Mastermind.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Themes:</strong> Air, Fire, Metal, Mind, Stone, Void, Water, Wind, Wood.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Values:</strong> Duty, Glory, Justice, Love, Power, Safety, Truth, Vengeance.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you want a longer list, try starting with the default list, adding,
combining, and removing skills from it as needed until you land on what
you’re after. You could instead blend together two or more lists from
the above in some form.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Advancement:</strong> The smaller the number of skills in your list vs. the
default, the less frequent you’ll want skill point awards from
advancement. Perhaps allow them only during “power ups” (<strong>page XX</strong>), or
restrict them another way.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Alternatives to the pyramid:</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Diamond:</strong> A broad middle (about a third of them) that tapers towards
the top and bottom of the range, <em>e.g.,</em> 1 at +0, 2 at +1, 3 at +2, 2 at
+3, 1 at +4.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Column:</strong> A roughly equal number of skills rated at each tier. If your
list is short enough, this might be a line, one skill per tier.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Free + Cap:</strong> Give players enough skill points to make a pyramid (or
other shape), but don’t mandate it. They can buy whatever, staying under
the cap.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Coverage:</strong> Make sure to consider how many skills you expect to be rated
out of the total. The default list has ratings in 53% (10 of 19). The
higher the percentage, the more overlap players might have. Preserve
niche protection.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Combination:</strong> You may want to have two lists, with players adding
together one from each to make their roll. The main thing to keep in
mind is keeping the potential totals inside the zero-to-cap range. You
might have ratings from +0 to +2 on each list, or -1 to +1 on one and +1
to +3 on the other, etc.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>If a player is comfortable making quick creative decisions in the
moment, they may enjoy creating characters <em>as they play</em> rather than
ahead of time. This mimics the way characters reveal themselves and
develop in other media. It’s not for everyone, but for groups where the
method clicks it can be a real crowd-pleaser.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>With this method, characters start with only a name, high concept
aspect, and highest skill—if that! As play progresses and they are
called on to use an unrated skill, they can choose an empty slot and
reveal their knowledge of it in the moment. Similarly, aspects and
stunts can be filled in when the circumstances that call for them, right
in the moment a fate point is spent or a bonus claimed.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_countdowns"><a class="anchor" href="#_countdowns"></a><a class="link" href="#_countdowns">A.8.4. Countdowns</a></h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A countdown adds urgency to an adversary or situation: deal with it now
or things will get worse. Whether you’re talking about a ticking bomb, a
ritual near completion, a bus teetering on the edge of a suspension
bridge, or a soldier with a radio who’s about to call in reinforcements,
countdowns force the PCs to act quickly or face a worse outcome.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Countdowns have three components: a countdown track, one or more
triggers, and an outcome.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <strong>countdown track</strong> looks a lot like a stress track: it’s a row of
boxes that you mark from left to right. Every time you check off a box,
the countdown gets closer to being over. The shorter the track, the
faster their doom approaches.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A <strong>trigger</strong> is an event that marks a box on the countdown track. It can
be as simple as “a minute/hour/day/exchange elapses” or as specific as
“the villain takes a consequence or gets taken out.”</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When you mark the last box, the countdown ends and the <strong>outcome</strong>
happens, whatever it is.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>GMs might wish to reveal the existence of a countdown track to players
without telling them what it represents, at first, as a kind of
foreshadowing and to turn up the feeling of tension in the story.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A countdown can have more than one trigger if you want; perhaps the
countdown proceeds at a predictable pace until something happens that
accelerates it. You could also give a different trigger to each box on
the countdown track, if you want a specific series of events to set off
the outcome.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Extreme consequences introduce an optional fourth severity of
consequence to your game: something that permanently, irrevocably
changes a character.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Taking an extreme consequence reduces stress taken by 8. When taken, you
must <strong>replace</strong> one of your character’s existing aspects (other than
their high concept, which is off-limits) with an aspect that represents
the profound change to the character resulting from the harm they’ve
taken.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>By default, there is no option to recover from an extreme consequence.
It has become a part of the character now. At your next major milestone
you may rename it to reflect how you’ve come to terms with it, but you
can’t go back to the original aspect.</p>
</div>

<p>Between major milestones, a character may only use this option once.</p>

<h4 id="_full_defense"><a class="anchor" href="#_full_defense"></a><a class="link" href="#_full_defense">A.8.7. Full Defense</a></h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Sometimes a player (or GM) may want their character to go all-in on
using defend until their next turn, rather than taking an action on
their turn. This is called <strong>full defense</strong>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When declaring full defense, you must be clear about the <strong>focus</strong> of your
efforts. By default, you are defending yourself (from attacks and
efforts to create advantages on you), but you may wish to specify
someone you’re protecting, or a defense against a particular group of
aggressors, or a particular effort or outcome you wish to oppose.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>While on full defense you get a +2 to all defend rolls relevant to your
declared focus</strong>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If nothing comes of it and you haven’t rolled to defend at all by the
time your next turn comes around, you gain a boost (<strong>page XX</strong>) as you’ve
gotten the opportunity to prepare for your next action. This offsets
“losing a turn” because you focused your efforts on defending against
something that didn’t happen at all.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_obstacles"><a class="anchor" href="#_obstacles"></a><a class="link" href="#_obstacles">A.8.8. Obstacles</a></h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The defining quality of enemies is that they can be attacked and taken
out. By contrast, the defining quality of <strong>obstacles</strong> is that they
can’t. Obstacles make scenes demonstrably more difficult on the PCs, but
the PCs cannot simply fight them. Obstacles must be circumvented,
endured, or rendered irrelevant.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>While most obstacles are features of the environment, some might be
characters that can’t be taken out using conventional methods. The
dragon might be a boss, but it might just as easily be a hazard
obstacle. The animate statue keeping you from getting to the evil wizard
might be a threat, but it could also be a block or a distraction. It all
depends on the adversary’s function in the scene, and how PCs must deal
with it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Obstacles don’t appear in every scene. They serve to accent enemies in
the scene, to make them more threatening or memorable, but overuse of
obstacles can be frustrating to the PCs, particularly those focused on
combat. You <em>can</em> use them to give less combative PCs something to do
during a fight, though.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are three kinds of obstacles: hazards, blocks, and distactions.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_hazards"><a class="anchor" href="#_hazards"></a><a class="link" href="#_hazards">Hazards</a></h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If an obstacle can attack the PCs, it’s a <strong>hazard</strong>. Fire jets, rolling
boulders, or a sniper too far away to be dealt with directly—they’re all
hazards. Every hazard has a name, a skill rating, and a Weapon rating
(<strong>page XX</strong>) of 1 to 4.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The hazard’s name is both a skill and an aspect; that is, the name
defines what the hazard can do, and its skill rating defines how good it
is at doing that, but the name can also be invoked or compelled like any
aspect.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Generally speaking, a hazard’s skill rating should be at least as high
as the PCs’ highest skill rating, if not a little bit higher. A hazard
with a very high skill rating <em>and</em> a very high Weapon rating will
likely take out a PC or two. You could also make a hazard with a lower
skill rating but a high Weapon rating, making for something that doesn’t
hit often but hits hard when it does. Reversing that makes a hazard that
hits frequently but doesn’t do much damage.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A hazard acts in the initiative just like the PCs and their enemies do.
If your rules require everyone to roll for initiative, hazards will roll
with their rating. On its turn each exchange, a hazard acts as implied
by its name, and rolls with its rating. If it attacks and succeeds, add
its Weapon rating to its shifts. Hazards can attack or create
advantages; they can’t be attacked, and they don’t overcome obstacles.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If a player wants to overcome or create an advantage against a hazard,
they’ll face passive opposition equal to the hazard’s rating.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_blocks"><a class="anchor" href="#_blocks"></a><a class="link" href="#_blocks">Blocks</a></h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Where hazards exist to hurt the PCs, <strong>blocks</strong> prevent them from doing
things they want to do. Blocks <em>can</em> cause stress, though they don’t
always. The chief differences between blocks and hazards is that blocks
don’t take actions and are more difficult to remove. Blocks provide
passive opposition in certain circumstances, and can threaten or cause
harm if not heeded.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Like hazards, blocks have a name and a skill rating, and the name is
both a skill and an aspect. Unlike hazards, a block’s skill rating
shouldn’t be much higher than one step above the PCs’ highest skill
rating; otherwise, things can get frustrating quickly. A block can have
a Weapon rating as high as 4, but it doesn’t need to have one.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Blocks only come into play under specific circumstances. A <strong>Vat of Acid</strong>
only matters when someone tries to cross it or gets thrown into it. A
<strong>Chain Link Fence</strong> only affects someone who tries to get past it. The
<strong>Animate Statue</strong> only prevents entry into a specific room.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Blocks don’t attack and don’t have a turn in the initiative order.
Instead, whenever a block would interfere with someone’s action, they’ll
have to roll against the block’s rating as a set difficulty. If the
block can’t cause harm, it simply prevents the PC from taking the action
they wanted to. If it can cause harm and the PC fails to overcome the
block, the PC takes a hit equal to the amount by which they missed the
target.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Characters may try to force someone into a block as an attack. If you do
this, you’ll roll to attack as normal, but add a Weapon rating equal to
half the block’s Weapon rating (rounded down, minimum 1).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Finally, some blocks can be used as cover or as armor. This is
situational—for some blocks, it simply won’t make sense. You probably
can’t hide behind a <strong>Vat of Acid</strong>, but a <strong>Chain Link Fence</strong> <em>is</em>
effective protection against a baseball bat, probably preventing the
attack altogether.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When someone’s using a block as cover, decide whether it mitigates or
negates the attack. If it negates it, the attack simply isn’t possible.
If it mitigates it, the defender gets an Armor rating equal to half the
block’s skill rating (rounded down, minimum 1).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Use blocks sparingly. Blocks make it harder for PCs to take certain
actions—so they can be frustrating if you overuse them—but they can also
lead the players to think creatively. They may see an opportunity to
turn blocks to their advantage. If they figure out how, let them!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Sometimes players will just want to remove blocks outright. To do so,
make an overcome roll against a set difficulty equal to the block’s
rating plus two.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_distractions"><a class="anchor" href="#_distractions"></a><a class="link" href="#_distractions">Distractions</a></h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Where hazards attack the PCs directly and blocks prevent them from
taking certain actions, <strong>distractions</strong> force the PCs to figure out their
priorities. Of the obstacles, distractions are often the least
mechanically defined. They also don’t necessarily make the scene
mechanically harder. Rather, they present the PCs with difficult
decisions. Here are the distraction’s parts:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>A distraction’s <strong>name</strong> is a brief, punchy representation of what it
is. It can be an aspect, if you need or want it to be.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A distraction’s <strong>choice</strong> is a simple question that codifies the
decision it gives to the PCs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A distraction’s <strong>repercussion</strong> is what happens to the PCs if they
don’t deal with the distraction. Some distractions might have multiple
repercussions, including repercussions for <em>successfully</em> dealing with
the distraction.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A distraction’s <strong>opposition</strong> is its passive opposition against PCs
rolling to deal with it. Not every distraction needs to provide
opposition.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you’re afraid the PCs will deal handily with a fight you’ve got in
store, adding a distraction or two can force them to decide whether it’s
more important to trounce the bad guys or deal with the distractions.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Dealing with a distraction should always have a clear benefit or,
failing that, not dealing with a distraction should always have a clear
consequence.</p>

<h4 id="_scale"><a class="anchor" href="#_scale"></a><a class="link" href="#_scale">A.8.9. Scale</a></h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Scale</strong> is an optional subsystem that you can use to represent
supernatural beings which operate on a level beyond the general range of
capabilities of most characters in your game. Usually you don’t need to
worry about the impact of scale within your game. There may be times,
however, where it’s desirable to present the characters with a threat
bigger than they typically face—or an opportunity for the characters to
punch outside their usual weight class.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As an example—you may wish to change the list to something more suitable
to your setting—we’ll present you with five potential levels of scale:
Mundane, Supernatural, Otherworldly, Legendary, and Godlike.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Mundane</strong> represents characters without access to supernatural power
or technologies that would boost them beyond the capabilities of humans.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Supernatural</strong> represents characters who do have access to
supernatural powers or technologies reaching beyond human capacity but
who are still effectively human at the core.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Otherworldly</strong> represents unusual or unique characters whose powers
set them apart from the normal concerns of humanity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Legendary</strong> represents powerful spirits, entities, and alien beings to
whom humanity is more of a curiosity than a threat.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Godlike</strong> represents the universe’s mightiest forces: archangels,
gods, faerie queens, living planets, and so on.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When applying scale to two opposing forces or individuals, compare the
sides’ levels and determine who is higher, and by how many levels. They
get <em>one</em> of the following benefits on any rolled action against their
lesser:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>+1 per level of difference to their action <em>before</em> the roll</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>+2 per level of difference to the result <em>after</em> the roll, <em>if</em> the
roll succeeds</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>1 additional free invoke per level of difference to the results of a
successful create advantage action</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Frequent and rigid application of scale rules may put player characters
at a distinct disadvantage. Compensate by generously affording those
players opportunities to subvert scale disadvantage in clever ways.
Viable options include researching a target for weaknesses, changing the
venue to one where scale doesn’t apply, or altering goals so that their
opponent cannot leverage their scale advantage.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_aspects_and_scale"><a class="anchor" href="#_aspects_and_scale"></a><a class="link" href="#_aspects_and_scale">Aspects and Scale</a></h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Active situation aspects sometimes represent a
supernatural effect. In these cases, the GM may determine that invoking
the aspect grants the additional benefit of its scale. Furthermore, a
supernaturally created aspect can justify scale on some actions even
without an invoke, such as in the case of a veil or high-tech camouflage
suit; you need not invoke <strong>Veiled</strong> to gain Supernatural scale when
sneaking about.</p>
</div>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you are creating an advantage and <em>there is no opposition</em>, rather
than rolling you simply gain the aspect with one free invoke. That
aspect grants scale as previously described.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you are creating the advantage <em>on someone else to their detriment</em>,
such as casting <strong>Entangled by Animated Vines</strong> on your foe, you may gain
scale on your effort to create the advantage.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you are creating an advantage via supernatural means and <em>an opposing
party can directly impede the effort via physical or supernatural
interference,</em> your scale may apply against their defend roll.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>Otherwise,</em> you create the advantage without scale, but later use of
that aspect grants scale when appropriate.</p>

<h4 id="_time_shifts"><a class="anchor" href="#_time_shifts"></a><a class="link" href="#_time_shifts">A.8.10. Time Shifts</a></h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When determining how long it takes characters to do something, you may
want to use a more systematic approach to decide the impacts of success,
failure, and “at a cost” options. How much longer or faster? Let the
shifts decide, using these guidelines.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>First, decide how long the task takes with a simple success. Use an
approximate quantity plus a unit of time: “a few days,” “half a minute,”
“several weeks,” and so on. Approximate quantities for use include:
half, about one, a few, or several of a given unit of time.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Then look at how many shifts the roll exceeds or misses the target by.
Each shift is worth one quantity-step from wherever your starting point
is.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So if your starting point is “a few hours,” then one shift faster jumps
the quantity down to “about one hour,” two shifts down to “half an
hour.” Going faster than “half” drops the unit down to the next smaller
(hours to minutes, etc) and quantity up to “several”, so three shifts
faster would be “several minutes.”</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the case of slower, it’s the same process in the opposite direction:
one shift slower is “several hours,” two is “half a day,” three is
“about one day.”</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Between combining skills and creating advantages for teamwork (<strong>page
XX</strong>), a group of PCs can really overwhelm a single opponent. This is
fine if you want to respect the advantage of numbers, but not great if
you want to present a “big bad” that’s the equal of the whole group.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But remember, for monsters and other big threats it’s acceptable to
break the rules (<strong>page XX</strong>)—so do so by looking at ways to counteract
the group’s usual advantage of numbers, while still giving them a
chance. Here are a few suggestions for ways you might do that. You can
use one or more of these in combination for especially difficult or
terrifying final bosses.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_challenge_or_contest_immunity"><a class="anchor" href="#_challenge_or_contest_immunity"></a><a class="link" href="#_challenge_or_contest_immunity">Challenge or Contest Immunity</a></h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Both of these methods are about drawing out the final confrontation by
running the group through a clock-is-ticking-down activity before they
can actually go after the big bad directly.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>With <strong>challenge immunity</strong>, your big bad cannot be affected directly
(mentally, physically, or both) until the group beats a challenge (e.g.,
dismantling the source of its power, figuring out what its weakness is,
etc). The big bad, meanwhile, can act freely and may attack them during
their efforts, oppose their overcome or create advantage efforts with
its defend rolls, assail their free invokes with its own overcomes, or
prepare for their eventual breakthrough by creating advantages of its
own.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>With <strong>contest immunity</strong>, the group must win a contest to be able to
directly attack the big bad—and the big bad gets to attack them while
they’re trying. If the big bad wins the contest, it gets to pull off its
scheme and get away unscathed.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_expendable_minion_armor"><a class="anchor" href="#_expendable_minion_armor"></a><a class="link" href="#_expendable_minion_armor">Expendable Minion Armor</a></h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Surrounding yourself with minions is one way to try to balance a big
bad’s side against the PCs, but it only goes so far if the players can
just decide to go after the big bad directly and ignore those pesky
minions for a while.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But with <strong>expendable minion armor</strong> in play, a big bad may always succeed
at a cost on its defend rolls against attacks by forcing a minion into
the path of the attack. That minion doesn’t roll to defend, they just
take the hit that would have landed on the big bad otherwise. This
forces the PCs to chew through the big bad’s army before the final
confrontation.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And remember, minions don’t have to be <em>literal</em> minions. For example,
you might write up one or more “shield generators”, each one with a
stress track and perhaps a skill for creating defensive advantages for
the shielded big bad!</p>

<p>Okay, the group has thrown everything they’ve got at the big bad,
and—<em>awesome!</em>—they just took him out. There’s just one problem: that
just frees him from his cage of flesh to reveal his true form!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>With <strong>reveal true form</strong>, your big bad isn’t just one character, it’s at
least <em>two</em> characters which must be beaten sequentially, each one
revealing new capabilities and stunts, higher skill ratings, fresh
stress and consequence tracks, and even new “rule breaks.”</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you want to gentle this a bit, carry the consequences the big bad has
already taken forward between forms, dismissing the mild ones and
downgrading the moderate and severe ones by one step each.</p>

scale than the PCs, using the scale option from <strong>page XX</strong>. You could do

need only apply when a big bad takes the field!</p>

<h5 id="_solo_bonus"><a class="anchor" href="#_solo_bonus"></a><a class="link" href="#_solo_bonus">Solo Bonus</a></h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Players may enjoy a teamwork bonus, sure—but why not give your big bad a
complementary <strong>solo bonus</strong> when they’re the only one facing the heroes?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are a few ways you could implement a solo bonus. You could use
more than one of these, but be careful when combining them as they’ll
add up fast.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>The big bad gets a <strong>bonus to skill rolls</strong> that’s equal to the group’s
maximum potential teamwork bonus (<strong>page XX</strong>) — the number of PCs acting
against the big bad minus one (so a +2 vs a group of 3, etc). This bonus
can’t do better than double the big bad’s affected skill, though, just
as with PCs (or maybe you’ll break _that_rule too).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The big bad may <strong>reduce the stress</strong> of successful attacks by the
number of opposing PCs divided by two, rounded up. If you’re worried
this will make the fight run too long, then hits reduced this way can’t
be reduced below 1.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The big bad has <strong>amplified invokes</strong>: when making a <em>paid</em> invoke of an
aspect, their bonus is equal to the number of PCs they face. No such
luck with free invokes, but this makes every fate point spent utterly
terrifying.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The big bad may <strong>suppress invokes</strong>: when facing two or more foes, the
opposition’s invokes only provide a +1 bonus, or allow rerolls only,
when used directly against the big bad. Optionally, the big bad might
also remove the PCs’ ability to stack free invokes.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>In Fate, anything can be a character, so why not a map? When <strong>the threat

achieve victory.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>As you detail your big bad map, each zone might have its own skills,
aspects, and stress capacity. Some zones might contain simple challenges
that must be overcome in order to move deeper into the creature. Each
zone may take an action as a separate character against PCs occupying
that zone, or in the case of a zone representing a limb or similar, may
be able to attack adjacent zones as well. If a zone is taken out by one
of the PC’s attacks, it may be bypassed and no longer gets to take
actions of its own, but the overall big bad isn’t defeated until the
heroes can reach its heart and kill it true.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This method works particularly well if your big bad is a truly gigantic
monster, but need not be limited to that situation. You can use the idea
of treating the threat as a collection of interconnected characters,
without requiring that the PCs actually enter or navigate the big bad as
a literal map. Used this way, you’ve got a hybrid between a map and
expendable minion armor (<strong>page XX</strong>)—a <strong>hive of characters</strong>, after a
fashion. Some parts of the big bad must be defeated before the players
can hit where it is truly vulnerable, and those parts get to take their
own actions in the exchange.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Whether you fully engage the map idea or simply build the big bad as a
hive, you’re sure to end up with a more dynamic fight where the big bad
acts more frequently, and the players must figure out a plan of attack
that eliminates the threat piece by piece before they can finally put it
down.</p>

<h4 id="_ways_to_handle_multiple_targets"><a class="anchor" href="#_ways_to_handle_multiple_targets"></a><a class="link" href="#_ways_to_handle_multiple_targets">A.8.12. Ways to Handle Multiple Targets</a></h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Inevitably, someone at your table will want to affect multiple targets
at once. If it’s allowed, here are some methods you can use.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you wish to be selective about your targets, you may <strong>split shifts</strong>.
Roll your skill, and if the resulting total is positive, you can split
that total up however you like among the targets, who each get to defend
against the shifts you assigned to them. You must assign at least one
shift to a target, or you didn’t target them at all.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Sophie faces a trio of goons and wants to strike at all three in a
flurry of thrusts with her rapier. Thanks to an invoke and a good roll,
her Fight roll comes in at Epic (+7). She assigns a Good (+3) attack to
the one that looks the most veteran, and Fair (+2) to each of the other
two, for a total of seven shifts. They each then roll to defend.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In some special circumstances, as with an explosion or similar, you may
make a <strong>zone attack</strong> against everyone in one zone, friend and foe alike.
Here, you don’t split shifts; every target must defend against your
total roll. The circumstances and method must be right for doing this;
often the GM will require you to invoke an aspect or use a stunt to gain
permission.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you wish to create an advantage affecting a whole zone or group,
<strong>target the scene</strong> instead: place a single aspect on the zone or the
scene itself rather than placing separate aspects on each of the
targets. This has the added advantage of reducing overall book-keeping.
If someone insists on creating a separate aspect on each target, they
should be constrained to the shift splitting method.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>With any of these methods, all of the targets should occupy the same
zone. The GM may allow the occasional exception due to method and
circumstance.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Only one action type should be used—such as attacking several targets in
one blow, solving two problems at once with overcome, or swaying the
minds of a few key NPCs with create an advantage. A GM might allow two
different action types under special circumstances, but those actions
should make sense for the skill used by both.</p>

<h4 id="_weapon_and_armor_ratings"><a class="anchor" href="#_weapon_and_armor_ratings"></a><a class="link" href="#_weapon_and_armor_ratings">A.8.13. Weapon and Armor Ratings</a></h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Want to tap into a little bit of that combat equipment vibe other games
have? Consider weapon and armor ratings. In short, getting hit by a
weapon will damage you more, and having armor keeps that from happening.
(You could model this with stunts, but using stunt slots might not feel
right to you.)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A <strong>weapon</strong> value adds to the shift value of a successful hit. If you
have Weapon:2, it means that any hit inflicts 2 more shifts than normal.
This counts for ties; you inflict stress on a tie <em>instead</em> of getting a
boost.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>An <strong>armor</strong> value reduces the shifts of a successful hit. So, Armor:2
makes any hit worth 2 less than usual. If you hit but the target’s Armor
reduces the attack’s shifts to 0 or below, you get a boost to use on
your target but don’t do any harm.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Choose your range of ratings carefully. Keep an eye on how likely they
make a consequence (or worse) on a tie. We recommend a range of 0 to 4
at most.</p>

<h3 id="what-version-is-this-"><a class="anchor" href="#what-version-is-this-"></a><a class="link" href="#what-version-is-this-">A.9. What Version Is This?</a></h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Since late 2012, there has been only one version of Fate from Evil Hat:
<em>Fate Core System</em>, the fourth edition of the system.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Ah, but what about <em>Fate Accelerated</em>, the perspicacious Fate
afficionado might ask? Thing is, that’s Fate Core too—it’s the same
system, just with different <strong>dial settings</strong> (i.e., configuration
options/flavors) for stress tracks, the skill list, stunts, and NPC
design. Any apparent differences in the _core functions_of the system
are due to accidents of parallel development and can be considered
unintentional—with apologies to the rules lawyers out there! If a
conflict between the designs exists, Fate Core System is the authority.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>These two perspectives on Fate Core come together here, in <em>Fate
Condensed</em>—very literally, in fact. Condensed began as the Accelerated
text, minus all of the Accelerated dial settings, replaced by Core’s.
From that starting-point we applied eight years of community-play
experience to refine and clarify. That effort produced <em>some</em> minor
differences as noted on <strong>page XX</strong>, but whether you choose to play with
them or without, the system is still Fate Core at the end of the day. We
feel Condensed is an improvement for sure, but there are no edition wars
to be had here (and please don’t try to start one). It’s all Fate Core.</p>

<h4 id="_what_came_before"><a class="anchor" href="#_what_came_before"></a><a class="link" href="#_what_came_before">A.9.1. What Came Before</a></h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Fate started as a hack of the Fudge system circa 2000, a culmination of
a few fevered conversations Fred Hicks and Rob Donoghue had about what
they might do to run another Amber game. The versions that arose between
then and 2005 were free, digital, and released to the Fudge community
online to a surprisingly enthusiastic reception. These spanned from
“Fate Zero” up to Fate 2.0.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Then, Jim Butcher offered them a chance to create an RPG based on the
Dresden Files, triggering the establishment of Evil Hat as a company and
a new take on the Fate system, first seen in <em>Spirit of the Century</em>
(2006) and eventually The <em>Dresden Files RPG</em> (2010). The version of
Fate found in both those (and thanks to open licensing, a number of
others) was Fate 3.0.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The effort to extract the system (by Leonard Balsera and Ryan Macklin)
to present it on its own led to many improvements, and that gave us Fate
Core.</p>

License

THE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS CREATIVE
COMMONS PUBLIC LICENSE ("CCPL" OR "LICENSE"). THE WORK IS PROTECTED BY
COPYRIGHT AND/OR OTHER APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF THE WORK OTHER THAN AS
AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS LICENSE OR COPYRIGHT LAW IS PROHIBITED.

BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE
TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE. TO THE EXTENT THIS LICENSE MAY
BE CONSIDERED TO BE A CONTRACT, THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU THE RIGHTS

1. Definitions

 a. "Adaptation" means a work based upon the Work, or upon the Work and
    other pre-existing works, such as a translation, adaptation,
    derivative work, arrangement of music or other alterations of a
    literary or artistic work, or phonogram or performance and includes
    cinematographic adaptations or any other form in which the Work may be
    recast, transformed, or adapted including in any form recognizably
    derived from the original, except that a work that constitutes a
    Collection will not be considered an Adaptation for the purpose of
    this License. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical
    work, performance or phonogram, the synchronization of the Work in
    timed-relation with a moving image ("synching") will be considered an
    Adaptation for the purpose of this License.
 b. "Collection" means a collection of literary or artistic works, such as
    encyclopedias and anthologies, or performances, phonograms or
    broadcasts, or other works or subject matter other than works listed
    in Section 1(f) below, which, by reason of the selection and
    arrangement of their contents, constitute intellectual creations, in
    which the Work is included in its entirety in unmodified form along
    with one or more other contributions, each constituting separate and
    independent works in themselves, which together are assembled into a
    collective whole. A work that constitutes a Collection will not be
    considered an Adaptation (as defined above) for the purposes of this
    License.
 c. "Distribute" means to make available to the public the original and
    copies of the Work or Adaptation, as appropriate, through sale or
    other transfer of ownership.
 d. "Licensor" means the individual, individuals, entity or entities that
    offer(s) the Work under the terms of this License.
 e. "Original Author" means, in the case of a literary or artistic work,
    the individual, individuals, entity or entities who created the Work
    or if no individual or entity can be identified, the publisher; and in
    addition (i) in the case of a performance the actors, singers,
    musicians, dancers, and other persons who act, sing, deliver, declaim,
    play in, interpret or otherwise perform literary or artistic works or
    expressions of folklore; (ii) in the case of a phonogram the producer
    being the person or legal entity who first fixes the sounds of a
    performance or other sounds; and, (iii) in the case of broadcasts, the
    organization that transmits the broadcast.
 f. "Work" means the literary and/or artistic work offered under the terms
    of this License including without limitation any production in the
    literary, scientific and artistic domain, whatever may be the mode or
    form of its expression including digital form, such as a book,
    pamphlet and other writing; a lecture, address, sermon or other work
    of the same nature; a dramatic or dramatico-musical work; a
    choreographic work or entertainment in dumb show; a musical
    composition with or without words; a cinematographic work to which are
    assimilated works expressed by a process analogous to cinematography;
    a work of drawing, painting, architecture, sculpture, engraving or
    lithography; a photographic work to which are assimilated works
    expressed by a process analogous to photography; a work of applied
    art; an illustration, map, plan, sketch or three-dimensional work
    relative to geography, topography, architecture or science; a
    performance; a broadcast; a phonogram; a compilation of data to the
    extent it is protected as a copyrightable work; or a work performed by
    a variety or circus performer to the extent it is not otherwise
    considered a literary or artistic work.
 g. "You" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this
    License who has not previously violated the terms of this License with
    respect to the Work, or who has received express permission from the
    Licensor to exercise rights under this License despite a previous
    violation.
 h. "Publicly Perform" means to perform public recitations of the Work and
    to communicate to the public those public recitations, by any means or
    process, including by wire or wireless means or public digital
    performances; to make available to the public Works in such a way that
    members of the public may access these Works from a place and at a
    place individually chosen by them; to perform the Work to the public
    by any means or process and the communication to the public of the
    performances of the Work, including by public digital performance; to
    broadcast and rebroadcast the Work by any means including signs,
    sounds or images.
 i. "Reproduce" means to make copies of the Work by any means including
    without limitation by sound or visual recordings and the right of
    fixation and reproducing fixations of the Work, including storage of a
    protected performance or phonogram in digital form or other electronic
    medium.

2. Fair Dealing Rights. Nothing in this License is intended to reduce,
limit, or restrict any uses free from copyright or rights arising from
limitations or exceptions that are provided for in connection with the
copyright protection under copyright law or other applicable laws.

3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License,
Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive,
perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright) license to
exercise the rights in the Work as stated below:

 a. to Reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more
    Collections, and to Reproduce the Work as incorporated in the
    Collections;
 b. to create and Reproduce Adaptations provided that any such Adaptation,
    including any translation in any medium, takes reasonable steps to
    clearly label, demarcate or otherwise identify that changes were made
    to the original Work. For example, a translation could be marked "The
    original work was translated from English to Spanish," or a
    modification could indicate "The original work has been modified.";
 c. to Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work including as incorporated
    in Collections; and,
 d. to Distribute and Publicly Perform Adaptations.
 e. For the avoidance of doubt:

     i. Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in
        which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or
        compulsory licensing scheme cannot be waived, the Licensor
        reserves the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any
        exercise by You of the rights granted under this License;
    ii. Waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in
        which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or
        compulsory licensing scheme can be waived, the Licensor waives the
        exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You
        of the rights granted under this License; and,
   iii. Voluntary License Schemes. The Licensor waives the right to
        collect royalties, whether individually or, in the event that the
        Licensor is a member of a collecting society that administers
        voluntary licensing schemes, via that society, from any exercise
        by You of the rights granted under this License.

The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now
known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make
such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in
other media and formats. Subject to Section 8(f), all rights not expressly
granted by Licensor are hereby reserved.

4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made
subject to and limited by the following restrictions:

 a. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the terms
    of this License. You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource
    Identifier (URI) for, this License with every copy of the Work You
    Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose any terms
    on the Work that restrict the terms of this License or the ability of
    the recipient of the Work to exercise the rights granted to that
    recipient under the terms of the License. You may not sublicense the
    Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and
    to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work You
    Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or Publicly
    Perform the Work, You may not impose any effective technological
    measures on the Work that restrict the ability of a recipient of the
    Work from You to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under
    the terms of the License. This Section 4(a) applies to the Work as
    incorporated in a Collection, but this does not require the Collection
    apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this
    License. If You create a Collection, upon notice from any Licensor You
    must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collection any credit
    as required by Section 4(b), as requested. If You create an
    Adaptation, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent
    practicable, remove from the Adaptation any credit as required by
    Section 4(b), as requested.
 b. If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any Adaptations or
    Collections, You must, unless a request has been made pursuant to
    Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and
    provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the
    name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied,
    and/or if the Original Author and/or Licensor designate another party
    or parties (e.g., a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for
    attribution ("Attribution Parties") in Licensor's copyright notice,
    terms of service or by other reasonable means, the name of such party
    or parties; (ii) the title of the Work if supplied; (iii) to the
    extent reasonably practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor
    specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not
    refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the Work;
    and (iv) , consistent with Section 3(b), in the case of an Adaptation,
    a credit identifying the use of the Work in the Adaptation (e.g.,
    "French translation of the Work by Original Author," or "Screenplay
    based on original Work by Original Author"). The credit required by
    this Section 4 (b) may be implemented in any reasonable manner;
    provided, however, that in the case of a Adaptation or Collection, at
    a minimum such credit will appear, if a credit for all contributing
    authors of the Adaptation or Collection appears, then as part of these
    credits and in a manner at least as prominent as the credits for the
    other contributing authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You may only
    use the credit required by this Section for the purpose of attribution
    in the manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights under this
    License, You may not implicitly or explicitly assert or imply any
    connection with, sponsorship or endorsement by the Original Author,
    Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your
    use of the Work, without the separate, express prior written
    permission of the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution
    Parties.
 c. Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be
    otherwise permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce, Distribute or
    Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or as part of any
    Adaptations or Collections, You must not distort, mutilate, modify or
    take other derogatory action in relation to the Work which would be
    prejudicial to the Original Author's honor or reputation. Licensor
    agrees that in those jurisdictions (e.g. Japan), in which any exercise
    of the right granted in Section 3(b) of this License (the right to
    make Adaptations) would be deemed to be a distortion, mutilation,
    modification or other derogatory action prejudicial to the Original
    Author's honor and reputation, the Licensor will waive or not assert,
    as appropriate, this Section, to the fullest extent permitted by the
    applicable national law, to enable You to reasonably exercise Your
    right under Section 3(b) of this License (right to make Adaptations)
    but not otherwise.

5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer

UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR
OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY
KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE,
INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY,
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF
LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS,
WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION
OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE
LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR
ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES
ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS
BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

7. Termination

 a. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
    automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License.
    Individuals or entities who have received Adaptations or Collections
    from You under this License, however, will not have their licenses
    terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full
    compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will
    survive any termination of this License.
 b. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is
    perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work).
    Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the
    Work under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at
    any time; provided, however that any such election will not serve to
    withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is
    required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this
    License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as
    stated above.

8. Miscellaneous

 a. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a Collection,
    the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same
    terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.
 b. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation, Licensor
    offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same
    terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.
 c. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under
    applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of
    the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action
    by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to
    the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and
    enforceable.
 d. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no
    breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing
    and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.
 e. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with
    respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings,
    agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified
    here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that
    may appear in any communication from You. This License may not be
    modified without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You.
 f. The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in this
    License were drafted utilizing the terminology of the Berne Convention
    for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (as amended on
    September 28, 1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the WIPO Copyright
    Treaty of 1996, the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty of 1996
    and the Universal Copyright Convention (as revised on July 24, 1971).
    These rights and subject matter take effect in the relevant
    jurisdiction in which the License terms are sought to be enforced
    according to the corresponding provisions of the implementation of
    those treaty provisions in the applicable national law. If the
    standard suite of rights granted under applicable copyright law
    includes additional rights not granted under this License, such
    additional rights are deemed to be included in the License; this
    License is not intended to restrict the license of any rights under
    applicable law.

    liable to You or any party on any legal theory for any damages
    whatsoever, including without limitation any general, special,
