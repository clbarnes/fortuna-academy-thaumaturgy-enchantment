Tables for inclusion in the document.

Consider tab separated values (`.tsv`) for simple content as it is highly portable and human-readable, and can be https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest/tables/data-format/[included directly].
For more complicated formatting needs, use asciidoctor's built-in https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest/tables/build-a-basic-table/[table format].

A TSV table inclusion may look like

[source,asciidoctor]

.My table title
[format=tsv]

include::tables/some_table.tsv
